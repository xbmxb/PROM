 The French prosecutor leading an investigation into the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 insisted Wednesday that he was not aware of any video footage from on board the plane. Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin told CNN that "so far no videos were used in the crash investigation." He added, "A person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators." Robin's comments follow claims by two magazines, German daily Bild and French Paris Match, of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board Germanwings Flight 9525 as it crashed into the French Alps. All 150 on board were killed. Paris Match and Bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site.   Story:  The French prosecutor leading an investigation into the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 insisted Wednesday that he was not aware of any video footage from on board the plane.

1. The Palestinian Authority has become the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court (ICC), giving the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. 2. The Palestinians signed the ICC's founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed "in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014." 3. Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. 4. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. 5. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians' efforts to join the body. 6. The ICC was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. 7. The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead. 8. The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since
1. Governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism to advance executions, Amnesty International alleges in its annual report on the death penalty. 2. The report, "Death Sentences and Executions 2014," cites the example of Pakistan lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in Peshawar in December. 3. China is also mentioned, as having used the death penalty as a tool in its "Strike Hard" campaign against terrorism in the restive far-western province of Xinjiang. 4. The number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22% on the previous year. At least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014, compared to 778 in 2013. 5. While the report notes some encouraging signs, it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014. At least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year, an increase of 28%
 Last year, governments around the world used the death penalty in a misguided, and often cynical, attempt to tackle crime and terrorism. Amnesty International has released its annual review of the death penalty worldwide, which makes for grim reading. In Pakistan, the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar in December. More than 60 people have been put to death since, and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows. Iran and Iraq executed people for "terrorism," and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes. In a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before, governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism. Other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates. Jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in December, putting 11 murder convicts to death, with the government
 Researchers at the Anne Frank House have discovered that Anne Frank and her sister Margot died at least a month earlier than previously thought. The new research contradicts the date of death which had previously been determined by Dutch authorities. The researchers re-examined archives of the Red Cross, the International Training Service and the Bergen-Belsen Memorial, along with testimonies of survivors. They concluded that Anne and Margot probably did not survive to March 1945. Anne Frank died of typhus in a Nazi concentration camp at the age of 15.

 A Duke student has admitted to hanging a noose made of rope from a tree near a student union, university officials said Thursday. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting "We are not afraid. We stand together,"  after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media. The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students. Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant. Two students were expelled. In February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi. A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus. In the news release
88 year old televangelist and founder of the television ministry "Hour of Power," Robert H. Schuller, died on Thursday after being diagnosed with esophageal cancer in August 2013. Schuller was also the founder of Crystal Cathedral megachurch. Schuller's life followed an almost Shakespearean arc. He was born in a Iowa farmhouse without running water and longed to preach from his earliest days. In his autobiography, "Prayer: My Soul's Adventure with God," he described standing alone by a river and picturing himself delivering sermons to a rapt congregation. After attending a Hope College and Western Theological Seminary in Michigan, he met his wife of more than 60 years, Arvella, while preaching at her church (she was the organist). With their young family in tow, the Schullers caravanned west to California, where he rented a drive-in theater and preached from the roof of the snack bar. It was beneath the dignity of Christian ministry, some local pastors huffed.
1. A stray dog in Washington State was hit by a car, whacked on the head with a hammer and buried in a field. 2. Four days later, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. 3. The dog, named Theia, is only one year old but suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity. 4. She still requires surgery to help her breathe. 5. A fundraising page has been set up to help pay for the dog's treatment. 6. Donors have already surpassed the $10,000 target. 7. Theia's foster carer is dedicated to making sure she gets the medical attention she needs and wants to "make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again!" 8. Any additional funds raised will be "paid forward" to help other animals. 9. Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the

Trey is looking to take up special education as a college major,
1. Michele Bachmann, former representative of Minnesota, compared President Obama to the co-pilot of the doomed Germanwings flight. 2. Bachmann wrote on her Facebook page that "with his Iran deal, Barack Obama is for the 300 million souls of the United States what Andreas Lubitz was for the 150 souls on the German Wings flight - a deranged pilot flying his entire nation into the rocks." 3. Many comments posted on her Facebook page blasted the former representative. 4. Negotiations are coming down to the wire between Iran, the United States and other nations on restricting Tehran's nuclear program to prevent the ability to develop an atomic bomb. 5. Bachmann is no stranger to voicing her opinion on the President's dealing with Iran, personally telling him to "bomb Iran" during the 2014 White House Christmas Party. 6. The congresswoman, who sought the GOP presidential nomination in 2012, said Obama had a "condescending smile on his face and laughed at me." 7. She

1. Walmart's opposition to the religious freedom law in Arkansas has put the company at odds with many in the Republican Party, which the company's political action committee has tended to support. 2. Walmart's evolution on these issues over the years is partly a reflection of its diverse consumer base, as well as a recognition of the country's increasingly progressive views of gay equality. 3. The backlash over the religious freedom measures in Indiana and Arkansas this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality. 4. The debate has reached presidential politics. National Republicans are being forced to walk the fine line of protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination. 5. Walmart is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot-button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals. 6. Walmart's actions "foreshadow where the Republican Party will need to move." 7. The Republican Party will have to better stand for ideas on helping the middle class, such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage
5 Americans who were monitored for three weeks at an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital after being exposed to Ebola in West Africa have been released. They were exposed to Ebola in Sierra Leone in March, but none developed the deadly virus. They are clinicians for Partners in Health, a Boston-based aid group. They all had contact with a colleague who was diagnosed with the disease and is being treated at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. As of Monday, that health care worker is in fair condition. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has said the last of 17 patients who were being monitored are expected to be released by Thursday. More than 10,000 people have died in a West African epidemic of Ebola that dates to December 2013, according to the World Health Organization. Ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. 2.

47 year old Andrew Getty, one of the heirs to billions of oil money, appears to have died of natural causes, according to a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman. The coroner's preliminary assessment is there was no foul play involved in the death of Getty, grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty. Andrew Getty had "several health issues," according to Detective Meghan Aguilar, adding that an autopsy will be conducted. Some medication had also been recovered from Getty's home, though investigators don't know whether Getty was taking it or what his medical history was.    The Getty family, one of the wealthiest in the US, has been hit by tragedy again, with the death of Andrew Getty, the 47-year-old grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty. Andrew was found dead in his Hollywood Hills home on Tuesday, and while the cause of death has not yet been confirmed, police have said that there was no foul play involved. Andrew was one of four heirs to the Getty fortune, which is estimated to be worth around $5bn.
 Indiana Governor Mike Pence has signed a religious freedom law that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign the bill, but he has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives. The very public debate that now embroils him is more than enough to drag the entire Republican field farther to the right than the party had hoped. There is no way a Republican can get through the pending primary without denouncing LGBT rights, which unfortunately will turn numerous Americans into single-issue voters. The issue of LGBT rights is going to be dragged down to a replay of Pat Buchanan's "cultural war" speech. <|im_end|>
1. Tropical storm Maysak is approaching the Philippines. 2. It was previously a super typhoon with sustained 150 mph winds. 3. It has since lost steam and is now classified as a tropical storm. 4.

37-year-old Louis Jordan was rescued after being lost at sea for 66 days. He had been drifting on a 35-foot Pearson sailboat since leaving Conway, South Carolina, to fish in the ocean. After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan. The weather wouldn't cooperate. Records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the Carolinas during the time he was missing. The precipitation came at night during harsh conditions. "I had tried to collect (rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat," Jordan said. "The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. "Finally the conditions were right. I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons. I filled up a bucket." Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned they were attracted to his laundry, which he would put out to sea for a rinse. The fish would swim in
1. Paul Walker died in November 2013 at the age of 40 after a car crash. 2. The release of "Furious 7" on Friday offers the opportunity for fans to remember the man that so many have praised as one of the nicest guys in Hollywood. 3. The actor was on break from filming "Furious 7" at the time of the fiery accident, which also claimed the life of the car's driver, Roger Rodas. 4. Producers said early on that they would not kill off Walker's character, Brian O'Connor, a former cop turned road racer. Instead, the script was rewritten and special effects were used to finish scenes, with Walker's brothers, Cody and Caleb, serving as body doubles. 5. There are scenes that will resonate with the audience -- including the ending, in which the filmmakers figured out a touching way to pay tribute to Walker while "retiring" his character. 6. At the premiere Wednesday night in Hollywood, Walker's co-star and close friend Vin
 The United States and its negotiating partners reached a very strong framework agreement with Iran in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Thursday that limits Iran's nuclear program in such a way as to effectively block it from building a nuclear weapon. Expect pushback anyway, if the recent past is any harbinger. Just last month, in an attempt to head off such an agreement, House Speaker John Boehner invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to preemptively blast it before Congress, and 47 senators sent a letter to the Iranian leadership warning them away from a deal. The debate that has already begun since the announcement of the new framework will likely result in more heat than light. It will not be helped by the gathering swirl of dubious assumptions and doubtful assertions. <|im_end|>
 Vince Neil's performance of the American national anthem before the Las Vegas Outlaws Arena Football League game was a disaster. Whitney Houston set the modern standard for the national anthem at Super Bowl XXV. Roseanne Barr's rendition was booed by the crowd at the San Diego Padres game and President George H. W. Bush called it "disgraceful." Jimi Hendrix's psychedelic take on the national anthem inflamed mainstream America. Michael Bolton's version at the American League Championship Series in 2003 was overly wrought and he had to use crib notes.<|im_end|>

 Sky watchers in western North America are in for a treat: a nearly five-minute total lunar eclipse this morning. It started at 3:16 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time, when the moon began moving into Earth's shadow.  For the next hour and 45 minutes, that shadow will move across the moon and engulf it at 4:58 a.m. Pacific Time. The total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds, and NASA says that makes it the shortest one of the century.  A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon form a straight line in space, with the Earth smack in the middle. The sun shines on the Earth and creates a shadow. As the moon moves deeper into that shadow, it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color.  NASA says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year, but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row, known as a "tetrad."  The first was on April 15, 201

 Easter is a cornerstone event in the Christian faith, but it's surrounded by interesting quirks. It celebrates the completion of Christ's mission of salvation in the Crucifixion and Resurrection. By dying on Good Friday, Christ atoned for the sins of others; by rising from the grave on Sunday, Christ conquered death. Simple enough and reason for Christians to celebrate. But, like Christmas with its tree, ornaments and Santa Claus, Easter has picked up its peripheral trappings -- the bunny and colorful eggs. ```  Easter is a cornerstone event in the Christian faith, but it's surrounded by interesting quirks.

Following a recent state-wide ban on the sale and consumption of beef, authorities in the city have asked residents to take a 'mugshot' of their cattle and submit it to the police. 3. Along with the photograph, the residents have to give information about their animal's 'unique features,' such as the coloring and age of the cow, along with the length of its tail and other distinctive characteristics. 4. Police officials believe this is the only way to solve cow slaughter cases and enforce the law. 5. Cows are considered holy and revered by that state's majority Hindu population. 6. So far over 100 owners have complied with the police order and more are lining up outside police stations across the city to get their livestock photographed. 7. The ruling came in the wake of a recent case of cow slaughter in Malegaon, where two men

1. Online activity has emerged as an alternative to traditional mainstream media. 2. The lack of access to traditional print and broadcast media in authoritarian countries is the driving force leading disaffected voices to post online. 3. Jailing critics is not usually the government's first choice in Singapore. It is part of Lee Kuan Yew's legacy that the government's use of the courts to bring libel and defamation cases, usually carrying heavy financial penalties, is the preferred method of silencing discomfiting online voices. 4. The biggest jailer of journalists in the world is China, where a majority of the 44 people behind bars at the end of 2014 were bloggers, most of them Uighur or Tibetan activists who straddle the line between journalism and activism. 5. Across Asia "governments have curtailed Internet freedoms through increasingly restrictive practices, including prohibitive laws, heightened surveillance and censorship, and threats of imprisonment on various national security-related offenses." 6. Since 1992, 11% of journalists

The NCAA's claim that it's hands-off when it comes to athletics seems to be a direct contradiction of what the organization has been repeating for years. 5. The NCAA has failed to open investigations in several cases where safety rules allegedly were broken. 6. The NCAA has fallen behind in imposing rules for concussions -- far behind even the NFL. 7. The NCAA has been founded a century ago to protect athletes from "dangerous and exploitive athletic practices," now says it does not enforce health and safety rules. 8. The NCAA has failed to ensure that athletes are academically prepared for college. 9.
 The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world's biggest and most powerful physics experiment, has restarted following a two-year shutdown. The LHC generates up to 600 million particles per second, with a beam circulating for 10 hours, travelling more than 6 billion miles (more than 10 billion kilometers) -- the distance from Earth to Neptune and back again. The purpose of the lengthy project is to recreate the conditions that existed moments after the "Big Bang" -- the scientific theory said to explain the creation of the universe. The LHC could also question the idea that the universe is only made of matter, despite the theory that antimatter must have been produced in the same amounts at the time of the Big Bang. The machine alone costs approximately three billion euros (about $3.3 billion), paid for by member countries of CERN and contributions by non-member nations. Scientists and physics enthusiasts will be waiting with bated breath as the LHC ventures into the great unknown.  Question: What is the purpose of the Large Hadron Collider? 
1. The Saudi-led coalition has bombed parts of Yemen's Defense Ministry Central Command in the capital over the weekend, senior Yemeni officials said. 2. The airstrikes have hurt the Houthis and destroyed a lot of infrastructure. 3. The electricity has gone out on 16 million Yemenis living in Houthi-held areas, the Yemeni officials said. Many fear they will lose access to clean water as well. 4. Since the bombing campaign and intense fighting began just over a week ago, some 600 people are estimated to have been killed. Many more have been wounded, and tens of thousands have fled the country. 5. The International Committee of the Red Cross has cried out for a humanitarian ceasefire to let aid in. 6. Following the ICRC's call, on Saturday the U.N. Security Council discussed the humanitarian situation at Russia's behest. Moscow submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes by the nine-country regional coalition. The meeting adjourned with no decision announced. 7. Yemen has been
20 states in the US have religious liberty laws, which have been growing since the US Religious Freedom Restoration Act became law in 1993. However, claims under those state RFRAs are "exceedingly rare," and victories involved mostly religious minorities, not Christian denominations, experts say. Here are some of the more interesting cases arising from the federal and state laws, touching upon an array of religious matters from a knife carried by an IRS accountant to a tea from the Amazon. Story: The United States has seemingly erupted this week about what it means to live your religion, especially in Indiana, where its new Religious Freedom Restoration Act faces a firestorm from critics who say it uses faith as a pretext to discriminate against gay people. Such state laws have been growing ever since the U.S. Religious Freedom Restoration Act became law in 1993, designed to prohibit the federal government from "substantially burdening" a person's exercise of religion. So far, 20 states have some version of the religious liberty law, and the legal controversies have grown, too
1. Al-Shabaab has claimed responsibility for the attack on Garissa University College in Kenya. 2. The attack is another step in the ongoing escalation of the terrorist group's activities, and a clear indicator that the security situation in East Africa is deteriorating fast. 3. Al-Shabaab is predominantly driven by the same radical interpretation of the Koran as al-Qaeda and ISIS (also known as Islamic State), but also employs more opportunistic approaches to shoring up local support. 4. The group's origins lie in Al-Ittihad al-Islami (Unity of Islam), one of several militant factions that emerged in the wake of the fall of Siad Barre in 1991. 5. Al-Shabaab (literally "the Youth") split from Unity of Islam in 2003 and merged with another radical Islamist group, the so-called Islamic Courts Union. 6. The first attack outside Somalia was an attack in the Ugandan capital of Kampala in 2010. Soon after this, cross-border raids
17-year-old Cassandra C. will remain in temporary custody of the state of Connecticut for the time being, according to her attorney, Josh Michtom. A Connecticut juvenile court judge issued a written decision Wednesday denying a motion to let the teen go home. The 17-year-old is in remission after nearly six months of forced chemo treatments. Cassandra was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in September and medical experts gave her an 85% chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy. Without it, doctors said at the time, she was likely to die within two years. She started chemotherapy in November but ran away after two days, according to court documents, when she decided she did not want to put the poison of the treatment into her body. In December, a judge ordered the young woman to be under the custody of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. At that time, she was admitted to Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford and has remained there since then. Her treatment is scheduled to wrap up this month. Representatives for the department have said in court and

63.5 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded in Antarctica on March 24, possibly the highest ever recorded on Antarctica. The World Meteorological Organization is setting up an international ad-hoc committee of about 10 blue-ribbon climatologists and meteorologists to begin collecting relevant evidence. The committee will examine the equipment used to measure the temperature, whether it was in good working order, whether the correct monitoring procedures were followed, whether the equipment was placed in the correct location and whether the measurement is matched by corresponding records from surrounding stations. The committee will discuss the issues and make a recommendation to Cerveny, who will make an official finding, probably by late summer or early fall. Researchers who study climate change carefully watch weather changes in the Antarctic region and elsewhere for evidence that the Earth is getting warmer. 2. What is the World Meteorological Organization? A specialized United Nations agency. A specialized United Nations agency that studies climate change.

55 year old Kim Ki-Jong has been charged with attempted murder, assaulting a foreign envoy and business obstruction after he stabbed US Ambassador Mark Lippert in Seoul last month. Kim has a history of unpredictable behaviour and in 2010 he received a suspended two-year prison sentence for throwing a piece of concrete at a Japanese ambassador to South Korea. South Korean President Park Geun-hye condemned the attack and said "This incident is not only a physical attack on the U.S. ambassador, but an attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance and it can never be tolerated."    MOST READ/SHARED BLOG POSTS 1.

1. Obama's political standing and his historic legacy in foreign policy are so deeply intertwined with reaching an accord with Iran that if the deal ultimately collapses, he may fear that historians will conclude that his legacy in global affairs collapsed with it. 2. The President may insist that the United States will choose no deal over a bad deal, but few people truly believe he has a credible Plan B. 3. The notion that Obama is not handling the Iranian threat effectively is contributing to a new war in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia and other Arabs are trying to push back against gains by Iran's allies. 4. The political imperative started to intrude in strategic considerations on an issue that is of transcendent importance to world peace. 5. The framework agreement announced on Thursday came two days after Obama's March 31 deadline. The U.S.-imposed deadline served only to pressure the United States, and the French ambassador very publicly decried as a "bad tactic." 6. Iran will be allowed to keep one-third of its more than 6,

 Rand Paul, who is running for president of the United States, is attempting to launch his campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation. Since coming to the U.S. Senate, Paul has tried to sell himself as a different type of Republican.  He's tried to brand himself as the GOP's minority outreach candidate.  The problem for Paul, and the GOP at large, is that they don't back up their words with their policies. Paul has also questioned the Civil Rights Act, and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate. When asked about the need for a more robust Voting Rights Act following the Supreme Court's dismantling of the law, Paul dismissively remarked, "We have an African-American President." Unfortunately Rand Paul has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle.  Paul tried once again from that stage in Louisville to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden Republican appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year. But his record makes it very clear that his views are
 The US Department of Justice has named FedEx as a new defendant in the war on drugs, accusing the courier delivery service of conspiracies, transporting prescription pharmaceuticals dispensed with illegal prescriptions, violations of the Controlled Substances Act, misbranding charges, and money laundering charges. FedEx has responded by saying that it is innocent, and that it is a common carrier, performing the normal duties of a common carrier, because it is engaged in the business of transportation of property and it offers its services to the public generally. The company has a strong argument for dismissal in this case, but even if not, it won't be swapping its logo orange for prison orange anytime soon.

1. Chris Rock has tweeted about being stopped by the police three times in seven weeks. 2. Many African-Americans have long bemoaned the phenomenon of being pulled over for no apparent reason, calling it "driving while black." 3. Blacks are about 30% more likely to be pulled over by police than whites, according to figures reported by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2013. 4. Actor Isaiah Washington urged Rock to "#Adapt" to avoid racial profiling. "I sold my $90,000.00 Mercedes G500 and bought 3 Prius's, because I got tired of being pulled over by Police," Washington tweeted. 5. Years ago, Rock filmed a sketch for his "Chris Rock" show on HBO in which he detailed ways to avoid being beaten by police as a black man. Besides obeying the law, he suggested bringing a white friend along for the ride. He did just that last year in a segment of "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee" with Jerry Seinfeld. The two

147 people were killed in a terrorist attack at Garissa University College in Kenya last week. Kenyans have used social media to share the victims' stories, hopes and dreams. The hashtag #147notjustanumber was used to tweet pictures of the victims in happier times. The attack killed 142 students, three security officers and two university security personnel, and was the nation's deadliest since the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 1998. The gunmen who attacked the university in the predawn hours separated Muslims from Christians and killed the latter. The extremist group has also killed Muslims in recent attacks. The Interior Ministry has identified one of the attackers killed by security forces as the son of a government official. The father of suspect Abdirahim Abdullahi is a chief in Mandera and had reported his son missing, officials said. The Islamist extremist group is based in Somalia, but it hasn't confined its terrorism to the nation that shares a border with Kenya. In 2013, militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall, killing nearly 70

 A couple relocating from Abu Dhabi to New York have lost their pet cat, Felix, after it went missing at JFK airport. The couple had booked Felix on an Etihad Airways flight from the United Arab Emirates to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on April 1. Shortly after the plane arrived in New York that evening, Felix went missing somewhere on the grounds of Kennedy Airport, according to Etihad Airways. Felix was able to get loose, Stewart said she believes, because the cat's plastic carrier was badly damaged at some point either during the flight or the transfer from the airplane to the pickup area. Nearly one week later, Felix remains missing. Etihad Airways is investigating the incident and is working with ground handlers at the New York airport to help locate the missing cat. The Abu Dhabi-based carrier also said it hired "third-party specialists" to help in the hunt for Felix. "We deeply regret this unfortunate incident and are keeping the owner apprised of the progress of the search," Etihad Airways told CNN in a statement. "We will

 Easter is a unique holiday on the Christian calendar that has always been able to resist the commercialization and culture warring that surrounds Christmas. Easter Triduum refers to the three days of Easter that begin with Good Friday, proceed through Holy Saturday, and conclude with Easter Sunday. Maundy Thursday is the day when Jesus celebrated the Last Supper with his disciples in the upper room in Jerusalem on the night before he was crucified. Good Friday is the day of the crucifixion, when Jesus was scourged and beaten, forced to carry his cross to Golgotha, the "place of the skull," and nailed to the cross itself for what must have been an agonizing death. Holy Saturday is a passageway between the darkness of the crucifixion and the bright hope of Easter. Easter embraces the great mystery of resurrection, with its promise of transformation -- a shift from one form to another, and a change that moves well beyond any literal understanding. The three days of Easter, the Triduum, occur only once a year on the calendar. But
 The article discusses how Jesus and his disciples supported themselves during their travels. The article suggests that Jesus and his disciples lived at a subsistence level, relying on begging and hospitality to meet their basic needs. The article also suggests that Jesus and his followers may have received donations from supporters, including some wealthy people who were drawn to his ministry. The article notes that women whom Jesus had healed provided for him out of their "resources," with Mary Magdalene and Joanna being two of the most prominent. The article also suggests that men like Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, both men of stature and wealth, may have chipped in to help fund Jesus' ministry. After the resurrection, the movement Jesus started grew exponentially, and the church's relationship to money grew more complicated as the needs became greater.  Overall, the article suggests that Jesus and his followers relied on the generosity of others to support themselves and their mission.<|im_end|>

1. Ted Cruz is the only official contender in the race. 2. He is counting on Iowa, known for its vocal and active evangelical base, to propel him forward in what's expected to be a tough competition among a crowded field of GOP candidates. 3. Cruz has built a brand as a stalwart conservative willing to buck GOP leadership on fiscal issues, but he showed in Iowa last week that he's also eager to champion social issues at a time when many Republicans are anxious to avoid them. 4. Cruz's first television ads are appearing this weekend during programs on Fox News and NBC that are pegged to Easter Sunday. 5. His stump speech hits on elements that appeal to each faction. He received standing ovations last week for calling to abolish the IRS, and, in a knock against the National Security Agency, he frequently tells audiences to leave their cell phones on so President Obama "can hear every word I have to say." 6. Cruz frequently says he wants to see a return of the evangelical vote to 2004 levels,

21 year old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been found guilty of all 30 counts he faced in the Boston Marathon bombing trial. 17 of the 30 counts were capital charges, meaning he is eligible for the death penalty. The trial will next move into a penalty phase, where the jury will hear testimony and arguments from both sides and ultimately be tasked with deciding whether Tsarnaev will be executed. Since testimony began March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. Tsarnaev's defense attorney Judy Clarke tried to convince jurors that her client's older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack, was the instigator of the marathon plot. The younger man, Clarke said, was only following his older brother. After the verdict, CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said Clarke now faces an uphill battle. "Because No. 1, he (Tsarnaev) is almost functioning as an

1. The California Public Utilities Commission has ordered Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to pay a record $1.6 billion penalty for unsafe operation of its gas transmission system, including the pipeline rupture that killed eight people in San Bruno in September 2010. 2. Most of the penalty amounts to forced spending on improving pipeline safety. Of the $1.6 billion, $850 million will go to "gas transmission pipeline safety infrastructure improvements," the commission said.

 Multiple tornadoes ripped through the rural Midwest on Thursday. A large and dangerous twister tore across fields in Iowa. And a twister touched down 70 miles outside of St. Louis. Eight tornadoes were reported Wednesday in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, the Storm Prediction Center said. But it appears residents have been fortunate enough to come away from the terrifying weather spectacle alive. Hail stones the size of tennis balls plummeted down on Ashton, Illinois. It could have been worse as severe tornado damage dotted a path not far from the dense populations of Chicago and Rockford -- the state's third largest city.  The tornado cut a 22-mile path through Ogle County, according to disaster management coordinator Tom Richter. North of Rochelle, a tornado took away a local favorite restaurant -- Grubsteakers.  "I have not been able to get a hold of him, Olson said, "but I know he's in touch with the sheriff and is safe," she said. Sheriff Brian VanVickle told journalists late Thursday that the tornado had

 The Secret Service is facing yet another scandal as a female employee has accused Xavier Morales, a supervisor within the agency, of assault after he made sexual advances at her. Morales was placed on administrative leave and his security clearance was suspended. This is just the latest chapter for an organization embroiled in scandal over the past several months. Last month, two top-ranking officials were suspended following an incident at a White House command post during an investigation of a possible bomb. Clancy was not made aware of the episode until five days later. The agency has also faced scrutiny for another lapse in late January when a drone crash-landed on the White House lawn. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson resigned in September after a fence-jumper gained access to the East Room of the White House. An independent report released in December found that the Secret Service is stretched "beyond its limits," needing more training, more staff, and a director from outside its ranks. Clancy, who formally assumed the post in February, is a 27-year veteran of the agency. The incident will

 Don McLean's "American Pie" has been sold for $1.2m at Christie's. The 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics was sold to an unnamed buyer. McLean wrote the song in 1971 and it became a cultural anthem for the generation lost in space. The song replaced Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are A Changin" as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade. The Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose "American Pie" as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century. The other four were "Over the Rainbow" (by Harold Arlen and E.Y "Yip" Harburg), "White Christmas "(by Irving Berlin), "This Land is Your Land" (by Woody Guthrie) and "Respect" (by Otis Redding). 
58 year old Anthony Ray Hinton has been released from Alabama's death row after nearly 30 years for murders he says he didn't commit. Hinton was convicted of murder in the 1985 deaths of two Birmingham-area, fast-food restaurant managers, John Davidson and Thomas Wayne Vason. But a new trial was ordered in 2014 after firearms experts testified 12 years earlier that the revolver Hinton was said to have used in the crimes could not be matched to evidence in either case, and the two killings couldn't be linked to each other. The state then declined to re-prosecute the case. Hinton was accompanied Friday by two of his sisters, one of whom still lives in the Birmingham area. Other siblings will fly to the area to see him soon, Stevenson said. His mother, with whom he lived at the time of his arrest, is no longer living, according to the lawyer. Hinton planned to spend at least this weekend at the home of a close friend. He will meet with his attorneys Monday to start planning for his immediate
