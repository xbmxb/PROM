 The French prosecutor leading an investigation into the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 insisted Wednesday that he was not aware of any video footage from on board the plane. Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin told CNN that "so far no videos were used in the crash investigation." He added, "A person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators." Robin's comments follow claims by two magazines, German daily Bild and French Paris Match, of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board Germanwings Flight 9525 as it crashed into the French Alps. All 150 on board were killed. Paris Match and Bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site.   Story:   The French prosecutor leading an investigation into the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 insisted Wednesday that he was not aware of any video footage from on board the plane. Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin told CNN that "so far no videos were used in the crash investigation." He added, "A person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators."

All 150 on board were killed.  Paris Match and Bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site. The two publications described the supposed video, but did not post it on their websites. The publications said that they watched the video, which was found by a source close to the investigation.  "One can hear cries of 'My God' in several languages," Paris Match reported. "Metallic banging can also be heard more than three times, perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object. Towards the end, after a heavy shake, stronger than the others, the screaming intensifies. Then nothing."  "It is a very disturbing scene," said Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of Bild online.  An official with France's accident investigation agency, the BEA, said the agency is not aware of any such video. Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini, a French Gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the Germanwings crash site, told CNN that the reports were "completely wrong" and "unwarranted."  Cell phones have been collected at the site, he said, but that they "
1. The Palestinian Authority has become the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court (ICC), giving the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. 2. The Palestinians signed the ICC's founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed "in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014." 3. Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. 4. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. 5. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians' efforts to join the body. 6. The ICC was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. 7. The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead. 8. The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June. 9. The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. 10. The ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as "Palestine." 11. While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. 12. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would "conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality." 13. Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development. 14. "Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure, and countries that support universal acceptance of the court's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership," said Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel for the group. 15. "What's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice, not Palestine's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members." 16. In January, when the preliminary ICC examination was opened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage, saying the court was overstepping its boundaries. 17. The United States also said it "strongly" disagreed with the court's decision. "As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC," the
1. Governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism to advance executions, Amnesty International alleges in its annual report on the death penalty. 2. The report, "Death Sentences and Executions 2014," cites the example of Pakistan lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in Peshawar in December. 3. China is also mentioned, as having used the death penalty as a tool in its "Strike Hard" campaign against terrorism in the restive far-western province of Xinjiang. 4. The number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22% on the previous year. At least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014, compared to 778 in 2013. 5. While the report notes some encouraging signs, it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014. At least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year, an increase of 28% compared with 2013. 6. The United States has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the Americas to conduct executions, but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly, from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014. 7. The report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death. "In the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed, the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards," the report stated. 8. Amnesty estimates that at least 19,094 people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014. Vocabulary: 1. Moratorium: a temporary prohibition of an activity. 2. Restive: (of a person) unable to keep still or silent and becoming increasingly difficult to control, especially because of impatience, dissatisfaction, or boredom. 3. Abolitionist: a person who favors the abolition of a practice or institution, especially capital punishment or (formerly) slavery. 4. Judiciary: the judicial authorities of a country; judges collectively. 5. Imperfections: a fault, blemish, or undesirable feature. 6. Dubious: hesitating or doubting; not to be relied upon; suspect. 7. Convicts: a person found guilty of a criminal offense and serving a sentence of imprisonment. 8. Fair
 Last year, governments around the world used the death penalty in a misguided, and often cynical, attempt to tackle crime and terrorism. Amnesty International has released its annual review of the death penalty worldwide, which makes for grim reading. In Pakistan, the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar in December. More than 60 people have been put to death since, and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows. Iran and Iraq executed people for "terrorism," and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes. In a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before, governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism. Other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates. Jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in December, putting 11 murder convicts to death, with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime. In Indonesia, authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety "national emergency." Six people have already been executed this year. A sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool.  The rise was largely because of developments in Egypt and Nigeria, where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict. The simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both. There is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence, as United Nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed. It is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough. At Amnesty International, we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades. Thankfully, most of the world now appears to agree with us. The numbers speak for themselves. In 1945 when the United Nations was founded, only eight countries had abolished the death penalty. Today, 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice. Last year, we recorded executions in 22 countries, down by almost a half from 20 years ago. Despite the troubling developments we recorded last year, there was still much good news
 Researchers at the Anne Frank House have discovered that Anne Frank and her sister Margot died at least a month earlier than previously thought. The new research contradicts the date of death which had previously been determined by Dutch authorities. The researchers re-examined archives of the Red Cross, the International Training Service and the Bergen-Belsen Memorial, along with testimonies of survivors. They concluded that Anne and Margot probably did not survive to March 1945. Anne Frank died of typhus in a Nazi concentration camp at the age of 15.

 A Duke student has admitted to hanging a noose made of rope from a tree near a student union, university officials said Thursday. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting "We are not afraid. We stand together,"  after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media. The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students. Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant. Two students were expelled. In February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi. A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus. In the news release, the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a "cowardly act." Duke University is a private college with about 15,000 students in Durham, North Carolina. <|im_end|>
88 year old televangelist and founder of the television ministry "Hour of Power," Robert H. Schuller, died on Thursday after being diagnosed with esophageal cancer in August 2013. Schuller was also the founder of Crystal Cathedral megachurch. Schuller's life followed an almost Shakespearean arc. He was born in a Iowa farmhouse without running water and longed to preach from his earliest days. In his autobiography, "Prayer: My Soul's Adventure with God," he described standing alone by a river and picturing himself delivering sermons to a rapt congregation. After attending a Hope College and Western Theological Seminary in Michigan, he met his wife of more than 60 years, Arvella, while preaching at her church (she was the organist). With their young family in tow, the Schullers caravanned west to California, where he rented a drive-in theater and preached from the roof of the snack bar. It was beneath the dignity of Christian ministry, some local pastors huffed. The "passion pits" where teenagers necked was no place for the gospel. Schuller was undeterred, and he quickly outgrew the drive-in. He called the explosive growth of his tiny congregation a "miracle," though his many mainstream critics had other names for it. His confident, breezy version of Christianity -- too breezy, by some estimations -- drew hordes of seekers and lapsed Christians who were put off by the hellfire fulminations of many post-War American preachers. Schuller sold a softer, gentler message, which borrowed heavily, he acknowledged, from the father of the feel-good gospel, Norman Vincent Peale. He preached not to convert or condemn people, but to encourage them, a sentiment he called "possibility thinking." People loved it. "Evangelicalism at its best wants to be innovative and reach people," said Timothy Larsen, a professor of Christian thought at Wheaton College in Illinois. "And Schuller was a master at that." "What he got right is that the gospel is good news," Larsen continued. "And he preached an uplifting message about personal transformation and uplift and hope." Some of Schuller's favored phrases, though, struck others as cornpone Christianity. "Turn your hurt into a halo?" said Randall Balmer, a professor of American religious history at Dartmouth College, citing one such phrase. "That's pretty weak tea." Still,
1. A stray dog in Washington State was hit by a car, whacked on the head with a hammer and buried in a field. 2. Four days later, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. 3. The dog, named Theia, is only one year old but suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity. 4. She still requires surgery to help her breathe. 5. A fundraising page has been set up to help pay for the dog's treatment. 6. Donors have already surpassed the $10,000 target. 7. Theia's foster carer is dedicated to making sure she gets the medical attention she needs and wants to "make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again!" 8. Any additional funds raised will be "paid forward" to help other animals. 9. Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks. A cat in Tampa, Florida, found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in January, showed up alive in a neighbor's yard five days after he was buried by his owner. The cat was in bad shape, with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye, but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the Humane Society.

Document: (CNN)A 7-year-old girl who lost her leg to cancer is now the youngest person to ever walk the runway at New York Fashion Week. Daisy-May Demetre, from Birmingham, England, made her debut last week for luxury children's wear label Lulu et Gigi after she was discovered by brand founder Eni Hegedus-Buiron on Instagram. Daisy-May was born with fibular hemimelia, a rare condition where part or all of the fibular bone in the leg is missing. She had her left leg amputated below the knee when she was 18 months old. Her father, Alex Demetre, said Daisy-May has been wearing prosthetic legs since she was a toddler and has always been active. "She's been doing gymnastics since she was a baby, and has always been very active," he told CNN. "She doesn't see herself as different from anyone else." Daisy-May's big break came when her father sent photos of her to a modeling agency. She was signed up by Zebedee Management, which specializes in models with disabilities. "We were contacted by Lulu et Gigi and asked if Daisy-May
1. Michele Bachmann, former representative of Minnesota, compared President Obama to the co-pilot of the doomed Germanwings flight. 2. Bachmann wrote on her Facebook page that "with his Iran deal, Barack Obama is for the 300 million souls of the United States what Andreas Lubitz was for the 150 souls on the German Wings flight - a deranged pilot flying his entire nation into the rocks." 3. Many comments posted on her Facebook page blasted the former representative. 4. Negotiations are coming down to the wire between Iran, the United States and other nations on restricting Tehran's nuclear program to prevent the ability to develop an atomic bomb. 5. Bachmann is no stranger to voicing her opinion on the President's dealing with Iran, personally telling him to "bomb Iran" during the 2014 White House Christmas Party. 6. The congresswoman, who sought the GOP presidential nomination in 2012, said Obama had a "condescending smile on his face and laughed at me." 7. She said he told her: "Well Michele, it's just not that easy." 8. The motive of the March 24 crash is under investigation, though investigators are looking in to whether Lubitz feared a medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot's license. 9. One deadline passed Tuesday, but there is a June 30 deadline for a comprehensive deal -- with all technical and diplomatic impasses fully worked out. 10. Bachmann is accused of taking desperate measures to stay in the public eye. 11. Many comments posted on her Facebook page blasted the former representative. 12. Melissa Coca wrote, "Comparing this tragedy to anything is moronic and despicable." 13. Michael J Pristash wrote, "Your allusion is so inappropriate and divisive, not to mention disrespectful on so many levels. Shame on you." 14. Lynda Anderson wrote, "Posting outrageous things in a pathetic attempt to stay relevant?" 15. Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525, is accused by authorities of deliberately crashing the plane in the French Alps. He died in the crash along with 149 other crew and passengers. 16.

1. California is a breadbasket to the nation, growing more than a third of its vegetables and nearly two-thirds of its fruits and nuts. 2. Prices rose last year for these items on your kitchen table: Berries rose in price by about 80 cents per clamshell to $3.88, Broccoli by 11 cents per pound to $1.89, Grapes by 64 cents a pound to $3.06, Melons by 24 cents a pound to $1.23, Packaged salad by 23 cents a bag to $2.91, Peppers by 26 cents a pound to $2.39. 3. Fresh fruit prices are projected to rise between 2.5% and 3.5%, and vegetables between 2% and 3%, close to historical average increases. 4. The Western drought affects more than 52 million people. 5. Consumers paid a whopping extra 12.1% for beef and veal in 2014. 6. Ranchers in Texas and Oklahoma last year saw smaller grazing pastures, paid more for feed, and experienced difficulties accessing water to cool their cattle. 7. This year's beef and veal prices should rise only by 6% at most, still higher than the 4.1% historical average, the feds project. 8. The 2014 wine grape harvest was "third in a string of great vintages this decade," the Wine Institute says. 9. Wine grapes use relatively low water, said institute spokeswoman Gladys Horiuchi. "Yes, drought years tend to produce terrific quality," she added. "With the record high California wine grape harvests in 2012, 2013 and 2014, there is a good supply of California wine." 10. The drought in California does have the potential to impact the price we pay for fresh fruit and fresh vegetables and dairy and fresh eggs we pay at the counter. Answer the following questions based on the above passage: 1. What is the impact of the California drought on the rest of the nation? 2. What is the impact of the California drought on food prices? 3. What is the impact of the California drought on beef and veal prices? 4. What is the impact of the California drought on wine? 5.

1. Walmart's opposition to the religious freedom law in Arkansas has put the company at odds with many in the Republican Party, which the company's political action committee has tended to support. 2. Walmart's evolution on these issues over the years is partly a reflection of its diverse consumer base, as well as a recognition of the country's increasingly progressive views of gay equality. 3. The backlash over the religious freedom measures in Indiana and Arkansas this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality. 4. The debate has reached presidential politics. National Republicans are being forced to walk the fine line of protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination. 5. Walmart is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot-button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals. 6. Walmart's actions "foreshadow where the Republican Party will need to move." 7. The Republican Party will have to better stand for ideas on helping the middle class, such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage, and prohibit discrimination in things such as jobs, housing, public accommodation against gays and lesbians. 8. The businesses are not afraid to wade into a politically controversial debate to ensure inclusive workplace policies. 9. The country's increasingly progressive views of gay equality are reflected in the support for same-sex marriage, which is at a new high of 59%, according to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. 10. The broader business community's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality is sending a message that equality is good for business and discrimination is bad for business. 11. The Republican Party is being urged to take notice of Walmart's actions and to move towards the middle ground. 12.

47 year old Andrew Getty, one of the heirs to billions of oil money, appears to have died of natural causes, according to a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman. The coroner's preliminary assessment is there was no foul play involved in the death of Getty, grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty. Andrew Getty had "several health issues," according to Detective Meghan Aguilar, adding that an autopsy will be conducted. Some medication had also been recovered from Getty's home, though investigators don't know whether Getty was taking it or what his medical history was.    The Getty family, one of the wealthiest in the US, has been hit by tragedy again, with the death of Andrew Getty, the 47-year-old grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty. Andrew was found dead in his Hollywood Hills home on Tuesday, and while the cause of death has not yet been confirmed, police have said that there was no foul play involved. Andrew was one of four heirs to the Getty fortune, which is estimated to be worth around $5bn. The family has been plagued by tragedy over the years, with J. Paul Getty's grandson, John Paul Getty III, being kidnapped in 1973 and held for ransom for five months. The family initially refused to pay the ransom, but eventually paid $2.2m for his release. John Paul Getty III was left permanently disabled by the ordeal, and died in 2011.    The Getty family has been hit by tragedy again, with the death of Andrew Getty, the 47-year-old grandson of oil tycoon J.

 Indiana Governor Mike Pence has signed a religious freedom law that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians. Pence is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign the bill, but he has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives. The very public debate that now embroils him is more than enough to drag the entire Republican field farther to the right than the party had hoped. There is no way a Republican can get through the pending primary without denouncing LGBT rights, which unfortunately will turn numerous Americans into single-issue voters. The issue of LGBT rights looks like it's going to be dragged down to a replay of Pat Buchanan's "cultural war" speech. <|im_end|>

37-year-old Louis Jordan was rescued after being lost at sea for 66 days. He had been drifting on a 35-foot Pearson sailboat since leaving Conway, South Carolina, to fish in the ocean. After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan. The weather wouldn't cooperate. Records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the Carolinas during the time he was missing. The precipitation came at night during harsh conditions. "I had tried to collect (rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat," Jordan said. "The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. "Finally the conditions were right. I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons. I filled up a bucket." Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned they were attracted to his laundry, which he would put out to sea for a rinse. The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. Jordan came ashore Thursday evening. CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital about 7:30 p.m. Coast Guard officials have said they have found no reason to doubt Jordan's incredible story. They noted that his father contacted them January 29 to report his son and his boat missing. Frank Jordan addressed the skepticism about his son's appearance, saying the boat stayed afloat and upright most of the time. His son spent most of his days in the cabin, out of the sun. Frank Jordan said it was obvious when the Jordans met at the hospital Friday morning that his normally low-key and private son had been through an ordeal. "I know he went through what he went through," Frank Jordan said. Jordan is an unemployed truck driver who lived on his boat at a marina in Conway. He had free rent and free food in the river, he said. But when it became difficult to catch dinner, he took off for the ocean in hopes he would land some bigger fish. Frank Jordan told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. And he had the strength to make it. "He's got a very strong constitution and (is strong) not only physically
1. Paul Walker died in November 2013 at the age of 40 after a car crash. 2. The release of "Furious 7" on Friday offers the opportunity for fans to remember the man that so many have praised as one of the nicest guys in Hollywood. 3. The actor was on break from filming "Furious 7" at the time of the fiery accident, which also claimed the life of the car's driver, Roger Rodas. 4. Producers said early on that they would not kill off Walker's character, Brian O'Connor, a former cop turned road racer. Instead, the script was rewritten and special effects were used to finish scenes, with Walker's brothers, Cody and Caleb, serving as body doubles. 5. There are scenes that will resonate with the audience -- including the ending, in which the filmmakers figured out a touching way to pay tribute to Walker while "retiring" his character. 6. At the premiere Wednesday night in Hollywood, Walker's co-star and close friend Vin Diesel gave a tearful speech before the screening, saying "This movie is more than a movie." 7. Diesel revealed in an interview with the "Today" show that he had named his newborn daughter after Walker. 8. Social media has also been paying homage to the late actor. 9. A week after Walker's death, about 5,000 people attended an outdoor memorial to him in Los Angeles. 10. Walker's younger brother Cody told People magazine that he was initially nervous about how "Furious 7" would turn out, but he is happy with the film. "It's bittersweet, but I think Paul would be proud," he said. 11. CNN's Paul Vercammen contributed to this report. Correct  Incorrect  Question 2 of 5 2 .

 The United States and its negotiating partners reached a very strong framework agreement with Iran in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Thursday that limits Iran's nuclear program in such a way as to effectively block it from building a nuclear weapon. Expect pushback anyway, if the recent past is any harbinger. Just last month, in an attempt to head off such an agreement, House Speaker John Boehner invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to preemptively blast it before Congress, and 47 senators sent a letter to the Iranian leadership warning them away from a deal. The debate that has already begun since the announcement of the new framework will likely result in more heat than light. It will not be helped by the gathering swirl of dubious assumptions and doubtful assertions. <|im_end|>
 Vince Neil's performance of the American national anthem before the Las Vegas Outlaws Arena Football League game was a disaster. Whitney Houston set the modern standard for the national anthem at Super Bowl XXV. Roseanne Barr's rendition was booed by the crowd at the San Diego Padres game and President George H. W. Bush called it "disgraceful." Jimi Hendrix's psychedelic take on the national anthem inflamed mainstream America. Michael Bolton's version at the American League Championship Series in 2003 was overly wrought and he had to use crib notes. <|im_end|>

 Sky watchers in western North America are in for a treat: a nearly five-minute total lunar eclipse this morning. It started at 3:16 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time, when the moon began moving into Earth's shadow.  For the next hour and 45 minutes, that shadow will move across the moon and engulf it at 4:58 a.m. Pacific Time. The total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds, and NASA says that makes it the shortest one of the century.  A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon form a straight line in space, with the Earth smack in the middle. The sun shines on the Earth and creates a shadow. As the moon moves deeper into that shadow, it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color.  NASA says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year, but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row, known as a "tetrad."  The first was on April 15, 2014. The second was in September 2014, the next is Saturday and there will be one more, on September 28.<|im_end|>
 Memories Pizza in the Indiana town of Walkerton is finding out what it costs to stand up for what you believe. The family-run restaurant finds itself at the center of the debate over the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act after its owners said they'd refuse to cater a same-sex couple's wedding. The statement struck at the heart of fears by critics, who said the new law would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians. They called for boycotts. But supporters also rallied. And by the end of the week, they had donated more than $842,000 for the business. Social media unloaded on the pizzeria in the community of 2,100 people that few folks outside northern Indiana knew existed before this week. Bad reviews flooded the restaurant's Facebook page, most having little to do with the quality of the food. Many too vulgar to share. But for every tweet and Facebook post taking Memories Pizza to task were words of support and a groundswell of financial support. Supporters rallied to a GoFundMe page in support of Memories Pizza. By the time the fundraiser ended late Friday, $842,387 had been raised. The purpose of the campaign is "to relieve the financial loss endured by the proprietors' stand for faith," according to Lawrence Billy Jones II, the man who started it. For the O'Connors their stand was no pie in the sky dream. It wasn't calculated but was spurred by their beliefs, they told WBND. "That's a lifestyle that you choose. I choose to be heterosexual. They choose to be homosexual," Kevin O'Connor told the TV station. "You can't beat me over the head with something they choose to be." Faced with threats against business, they're still weighing the cost.

1. Women have been barred from attending most sports events involving men since Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979. 2. A plan to allow "women and families" to enter sports stadiums will come into effect in the next year. 3. It isn't clear exactly which games women will be able to attend. 4. The restrictions would be lifted for indoor sports events. 5. Iranian authorities imposed the ban on women attending men's sports events after the revolution, deeming that mixed crowds watching games together was un-Islamic. 6. The Iranian government has come under pressure from international sports officials over the restrictions. 7. FIFA President Sepp Blatter called on Iran last month to end its "intolerable" ban on women attending soccer matches, saying the situation "cannot continue." 8. The ban on women attending matches was widely seen as a major impediment to Iran's chances of securing the event. 9. The ban came under the spotlight at the Asian Cup in Australia earlier this year, when thousands of female Iranian fans watched their soccer team without restriction. 10. During the match against Iraq, activists called for the ban to end and unfurled a banner showing the face of Ghoncheh Ghavami, a British-Iranian woman detained in Iran last year while trying to watch a volleyball match. Iranian officials have denied that Ghavami was arrested for attending the volleyball game, saying she was taken into custody for "anti-Iran activities." 11. The news agency Reuters reported that she was recently pardoned by the Court of Appeal. 12. The situation appears set to improve in the coming months after a top Iranian sports official said that the ban will be lifted for some events. 13. The rules won't change for all matches because some sports are mainly related to men and "families are not interested in attending" them. 14. Iranian women were briefly permitted to attend volleyball matches under the moderate President Mohammad Khatami, but the ban was reinstated in 2005 after the more hard-line Mahmoud Ahmadinejad came to power. 15.

1. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the deal six world powers struck to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions, saying he sees better options than "this bad deal or war." 2. President Barack Obama endorsed the deal, saying it was better than the alternatives. 3. Netanyahu said Iran is a country of "congenital cheating" and that it can't be trusted to abide by the terms of the deal, which lasts 10 years with some provisions extending well beyond that. 4. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, meanwhile, said she wishes Netanyahu "would contain himself." 5. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz defended the deal in an appearance on CBS' "Face the Nation" on Sunday, saying it would extend from two months to one year the "breakout" time period -- the length of time it would take Iran to build a nuclear bomb. 6. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said on "Face the Nation" that the best option for the United States is to keep current sanctions in place for two more years and then have a "new crack at it with a new president that doesn't have the baggage of Obama." 7. And he said the alternatives to Obama on both sides -- with the exception of Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who's called for a less active U.S. role overseas -- would likely strike a better deal. 8. "Hillary Clinton would do better. I think everybody on our side, except, maybe, Rand Paul, could do better," Graham said. Correct Incorrect  Question 2 of 5 2 . Question 1 points Summarize the given document. Document: The US and Cuba have agreed to restore diplomatic relations, which were severed in 1961. President Barack Obama said the two nations were starting a "new chapter" after historic talks between the two sides. Cuba's President Raul Castro called it a "new era", but warned that economic sanctions, in place since 1960, must be lifted. The US broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1961 after Fidel Castro's revolution. The US has maintained a trade embargo against Cuba since 1962. President Obama said he was ending what he called an "outdated approach" to Cuba, and urged Congress to lift the embargo. "We will end an outdated approach that for decades has failed to advance our interests, and instead we will begin to normalise relations between our two countries," he said. "Through these changes, we intend to create

 Easter is a cornerstone event in the Christian faith, but it's surrounded by interesting quirks. It celebrates the completion of Christ's mission of salvation in the Crucifixion and Resurrection. By dying on Good Friday, Christ atoned for the sins of others; by rising from the grave on Sunday, Christ conquered death. Simple enough and reason for Christians to celebrate. But, like Christmas with its tree, ornaments and Santa Claus, Easter has picked up its peripheral trappings -- the bunny and colorful eggs.  Unlike Christmas, it doesn't fall on the same day every year but shifts around in spring depending upon cosmic events. And that blood moon we just had -- is it pure coincidence that it fell around Easter? (No.) Here's a journey from the Vatican to the Holy Land, around the moon and the Earth's tilting axis, to Germany and the United States to try to explain the complex holiday called Easter. And you'll learn to how to color Easter eggs with Kool-Aid. Let's start at the Vatican. At the Vatican, Holy Week began with Palm Sunday last week and culminated in Easter Sunday Mass with multiple celebrations in between to mark the final week of Christ's mortal life. 
1. Police in the Indian city of Malegaon, in the western state of Maharashtra, are requiring identity cards for an unusual group of residents: Cattle. 2. Following a recent state-wide ban on the sale and consumption of beef, authorities in the city have asked residents to take a 'mugshot' of their cattle and submit it to the police. 3. Along with the photograph, the residents have to give information about their animal's 'unique features,' such as the coloring and age of the cow, along with the length of its tail and other distinctive characteristics. 4. Police officials believe this is the only way to solve cow slaughter cases and enforce the law. 5. Cows are considered holy and revered by that state's majority Hindu population. 6. So far over 100 owners have complied with the police order and more are lining up outside police stations across the city to get their livestock photographed. 7. The ruling came in the wake of a recent case of cow slaughter in Malegaon, where two men have been charged for killing the animal and and selling its meat. 8. The Maharashtra Animal Preservation Bill now includes bans on the killing of bulls and bullocks in its list of non-bailable offenses. 9. Even the consumption or sale of beef could now land you in prison for five years. 10. The slaughter of buffaloes, however, is still permissible. 11. Maharashtra is not the only Indian state to tighten its laws on cow slaughter. Haryana state has implemented a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison, the toughest penalty in the country. 12. Rajnath Singh, India's Home Minister has promised that he would do all to devise a country-wide law against cow slaughter. Correct  Incorrect  Question 2 of 5 2 .

1. Online activity has emerged as an alternative to traditional mainstream media. 2. The lack of access to traditional print and broadcast media in authoritarian countries is the driving force leading disaffected voices to post online. 3. Jailing critics is not usually the government's first choice in Singapore. It is part of Lee Kuan Yew's legacy that the government's use of the courts to bring libel and defamation cases, usually carrying heavy financial penalties, is the preferred method of silencing discomfiting online voices. 4. The biggest jailer of journalists in the world is China, where a majority of the 44 people behind bars at the end of 2014 were bloggers, most of them Uighur or Tibetan activists who straddle the line between journalism and activism. 5. Across Asia "governments have curtailed Internet freedoms through increasingly restrictive practices, including prohibitive laws, heightened surveillance and censorship, and threats of imprisonment on various national security-related offenses." 6. Since 1992, 11% of journalists killed have died for their work online. 7. Online journalists, operating outside the restraints of mainstream media, have become the most vulnerable targets for governments and independent actors. Where there is the restrictive rule of law, journalists are vulnerable to the anger of officialdom. Where the rule of law is weak, they are vulnerable to the attacks of killers who seldom, if ever, answer to the rule of law. 8. The bottom line: Online journalists, operating outside the restraints of mainstream media, have become the most vulnerable targets for governments and independent actors. Where there is the restrictive rule of law, journalists are vulnerable to the anger of officialdom. Where the rule of law is weak, they are vulnerable to the attacks of killers who seldom, if ever, answer to the rule of law. Vocabulary: 1.

 The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world's biggest and most powerful physics experiment, has restarted following a two-year shutdown. The LHC generates up to 600 million particles per second, with a beam circulating for 10 hours, travelling more than 6 billion miles (more than 10 billion kilometers) -- the distance from Earth to Neptune and back again. The purpose of the lengthy project is to recreate the conditions that existed moments after the "Big Bang" -- the scientific theory said to explain the creation of the universe. The LHC could also question the idea that the universe is only made of matter, despite the theory that antimatter must have been produced in the same amounts at the time of the Big Bang. The machine alone costs approximately three billion euros (about $3.3 billion), paid for by member countries of CERN and contributions by non-member nations. Scientists and physics enthusiasts will be waiting with bated breath as the LHC ventures into the great unknown.  Question: What is the purpose of the Large Hadron Collider?

1. The Saudi-led coalition has bombed parts of Yemen's Defense Ministry Central Command in the capital over the weekend, senior Yemeni officials said. 2. The airstrikes have hurt the Houthi rebels and destroyed a lot of infrastructure. 3. The electricity has gone out on 16 million Yemenis living in Houthi-held areas, the Yemeni officials said. Many fear they will lose access to clean water as well. 4. Since the bombing campaign and intense fighting began just over a week ago, some 600 people are estimated to have been killed. Many more have been wounded, and tens of thousands have fled the country. 5. The International Committee of the Red Cross has cried out for a humanitarian ceasefire to let aid in. 6. Saudi Arabia signed off on letting the ICRC into Yemen via two aircraft -- one with medical supplies, the other with workers. But flying in will be hard, since most airlines have canceled their flights, and airstrikes have taken out many airfields. 7. Following the ICRC's call, on Saturday the U.N. Security Council discussed the humanitarian situation at Russia's behest. Moscow submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes by the nine-country regional coalition. The meeting adjourned with no decision announced. 8. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Houthi rebels -- who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- forced Hadi from power. 9. The Houthis are allied with Iran, Saudi Arabia's bitter rival across the Persian Gulf, and Riyadh does not want an proxy of Iran in power on its border. 10. Complicating matters in Yemen is the fact that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- not the Houthis or the forces loyal to Hadi -- holds sway in the country's east. AQAP is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization. It has taken advantage of the chaos to overrun one city and break prisoners out of jail. Hadi's government had cooperated with the United States to fight AQAP, but with the Houthi takeover, that arrangement has evaporated, and the terror group operates generally unchecked. 11. The conflict prompted Saudi Arabia, a predominately Sunni nation and Yemen's northern neighbor, and other Arab nations to intervene with force. 12. The Houthis put Hadi under house arrest when they overtook Sanaa in January. But Hadi escaped in February, fled to Aden and declared himself to
20 states in the US have religious liberty laws, which have been growing since the US Religious Freedom Restoration Act became law in 1993. However, claims under those state RFRAs are "exceedingly rare," and victories involved mostly religious minorities, not Christian denominations, experts say. Here are some of the more interesting cases arising from the federal and state laws, touching upon an array of religious matters from a knife carried by an IRS accountant to a tea from the Amazon.    MOST READ INSIGHTS Interviews Euromoney Conference: Asia’s financial leaders are optimistic Read the magazine online Reconciling the US and China Read the magazine online Data privacy: the new battleground Read the magazine online Euromoney Conferences View more videos Follow us on Twitter Tweets by @Euromoney  The United States has seemingly erupted this week about what it means to live your religion, especially in Indiana, where its new Religious Freedom Restoration Act faces a firestorm from critics who say it uses faith as a pretext to discriminate against gay people. Such state laws have been growing ever since the U.S. Religious Freedom Restoration Act became law in 1993, designed to prohibit the federal government from "substantially burdening" a person's exercise of religion. So far, 20 states have some version of the religious liberty law, and the legal controversies have grown, too. Nonetheless, claims under those state RFRAs are "exceedingly rare," and victories involved mostly religious minorities, not Christian denominations, experts say. "There is reason to doubt whether these state-level religious liberty provisions truly provide meaningful protections for religious believers," wrote Wayne State University law professor Christopher Lund in a 2010 analysis, when there were only 16 states with such laws. Here are some of the more interesting cases arising from the federal and state laws, touching upon an array of religious matters from a knife carried by an IRS accountant to a tea from the Amazon: . He was a Native American with eagle feathers at a religious gathering of tribes. But not in the eyes of the feds. In 2006, Robert Soto and Michael Russell attended an American Indian powwow while in possession of eagle feathers, in violation of the federal Eagle Protection Act, which outlaws the killing of bald and golden eagles and even picking their feathers off the ground. Soto, a Lipan Apache, asserted he was participating in an Indian religious ceremony. The feathers are sacred to Native Americans. But a federal Fish and Wildlife Service agent found his tribe wasn't federally recognized
1. Al-Shabaab has claimed responsibility for the attack on Garissa University College in Kenya. 2. The attack is another step in the ongoing escalation of the terrorist group's activities, and a clear indicator that the security situation in East Africa is deteriorating fast. 3. Al-Shabaab is predominantly driven by the same radical interpretation of the Koran as al-Qaeda and ISIS (also known as Islamic State), but also employs more opportunistic approaches to shoring up local support. 4. The group's origins lie in Al-Ittihad al-Islami (Unity of Islam), one of several militant factions that emerged in the wake of the fall of Siad Barre in 1991. 5. Al-Shabaab (literally "the Youth") split from Unity of Islam in 2003 and merged with another radical Islamist group, the so-called Islamic Courts Union. 6. The first attack outside Somalia was an attack in the Ugandan capital of Kampala in 2010. Soon after this, cross-border raids in Kenya began, predominantly targeting Christians there. 7. Increasing its links with al-Qaeda, Al-Shabaab declared its full allegiance in 2012 -- and it is not clear whether it will switch allegiances to ISIS. 8. The key point is that Al-Shabaab's attack in Garissa is part of a broader regional context of instability fueled by a huge number of factors. 9. It must not be interpreted simply as another act of garden-variety fundamentalist terrorism. 10. Clearly, the presence and activities of terrorist groups in the region is a major concern, and it is undoubtedly driven by radical and exclusivist interpretations of Islam. 11. But the entire region also suffers from a range of other problems: from economic development challenges to environmental degradation; from organized crime to inter-tribal and inter-communal violence; from corruption to serious deficits in human rights and good governance. 12. These entrenched inequalities help Al-Shabaab appeal to a wide variety of potential recruits, who may sympathize with and actively support the group for any number of reasons. 13. Attacking a university in northern Kenya and separating Christian from Muslim students epitomizes the way Al-Shabaab advances itself by exploiting religious, tribal and nationalist identities. 14. Ultimately, though, this all comes down to a struggle for control -- over people, over territory, and over resources. 15. As long as the majority of people in the region remain
17-year-old Cassandra C. will remain in temporary custody of the state of Connecticut for the time being, according to her attorney, Josh Michtom. A Connecticut juvenile court judge issued a written decision Wednesday denying a motion to let the teen go home. The 17-year-old is in remission after nearly six months of forced chemo treatments. Cassandra was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in September and medical experts gave her an 85% chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy. Without it, doctors said at the time, she was likely to die within two years. She started chemotherapy in November but ran away after two days, according to court documents, when she decided she did not want to put the poison of the treatment into her body. In December, a judge ordered the young woman to be under the custody of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. At that time, she was admitted to Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford and has remained there since then. Her treatment is scheduled to wrap up this month. Representatives for the department have said in court and in conversations with Michtom and Taylor that they will withdraw their pending neglect petition once Cassandra completes her last round of chemo -- expected around the end of April -- and that she'll be allowed to return home. So for now, Cassandra is said to spend her days reading, watching TV and drawing. "The hospital is effectively jail," Michtom said.  Question: What is the current status of Cassandra C.?

63.5 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded in Antarctica on March 24, possibly the highest ever recorded on Antarctica. The World Meteorological Organization is setting up an international ad-hoc committee of about 10 blue-ribbon climatologists and meteorologists to begin collecting relevant evidence. The committee will examine the equipment used to measure the temperature, whether it was in good working order, whether the correct monitoring procedures were followed, whether the equipment was placed in the correct location and whether the measurement is matched by corresponding records from surrounding stations. The committee will discuss the issues and make a recommendation to Cerveny, who will make an official finding, probably by late summer or early fall. Researchers who study climate change carefully watch weather changes in the Antarctic region and elsewhere for evidence that the Earth is getting warmer. 2.

55 year old Kim Ki-Jong has been charged with attempted murder, assaulting a foreign envoy and business obstruction after he stabbed US Ambassador Mark Lippert in Seoul last month. Kim has a history of unpredictable behaviour and in 2010 he received a suspended two-year prison sentence for throwing a piece of concrete at a Japanese ambassador to South Korea. South Korean President Park Geun-hye condemned the attack and said "This incident is not only a physical attack on the U.S. ambassador, but an attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance and it can never be tolerated."    MOST READ/SHARED BLOG POSTS 1.

1. Obama's political standing and his historic legacy in foreign policy are so deeply intertwined with reaching an accord with Iran that if the deal ultimately collapses, he may fear that historians will conclude that his legacy in global affairs collapsed with it. 2. The President may insist that the United States will choose no deal over a bad deal, but few people truly believe he has a credible Plan B. 3. The notion that Obama is not handling the Iranian threat effectively is contributing to a new war in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia and other Arabs are trying to push back against gains by Iran's allies. 4. The political imperative started to intrude in strategic considerations on an issue that is of transcendent importance to world peace. 5. The framework agreement announced on Thursday came two days after Obama's March 31 deadline. The U.S.-imposed deadline served only to pressure the United States, and the French ambassador very publicly decried as a "bad tactic." 6. Iran will be allowed to keep one-third of its more than 6,000 centrifuges. That's not a small symbolic number. And it does not appear as though any of its nuclear facilities will be dismantled, although Fordow will contain no nuclear materials. 7. The negotiations' starting point is that Iran would like to have the bomb and the international community wants to delay that as much as possible -- and preferably, forever. 8. The world only learned about Iran's secret facilities at Arak and Natanz after dissidents raised the alarm. Iran, we have learned repeatedly, is very good at lying to international inspectors. It is well-established that it has had something to hide about its nuclear program. It is well-established that many of Iran's neighbors don't trust it and are anxious about the U.S.-led international dealings with Iran. It is well-established that Iran has engaged in international terrorism and in destabilizing the region. It is also clear that it took harsh international sanctions and a collapse in oil prices to bring Iran to the negotiating table. It was Iran that had the most to lose from a failure of talks. 9. The framework agreement starts lifting those indispensable sanctions much too soon. Nuclear enrichment will continue, although at a lower level. Iran officially, legally, becomes a nuclear threshold state, with the capability to make the final dash to a bomb within a "breakout" period of one year, the time when presumably inspectors would discover violation and allow the rest of the world to act. Even the Fordow facility,

1. The Japanese Defense Minister, Gen Nakatani, has told the Diet that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) has never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object. 2. The statement was made in response to a query from former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki. 3. Inoki had asked if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats, and if research was being done into alien visitors. 4. Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes, but admitted that he didn't know personally if aliens existed. 5. In 2007, then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications, under Japan's pacifist constitution, of a defense against an invasion from outer space.  The classic video game "Space Invaders" was developed in Japan back in the late 1970's -- and now their real-life counterparts are the topic of an earnest political discussion in Japan's corridors of power. Luckily, Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government's top military official earnestly revealed that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object. Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet, Japan's parliament, that his jets had, to date, never come across any UFOs from outer space. "When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country's airspace, it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation," Nakatani said. He continued: "They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I don't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth." Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as "among the most respected men in sports-entertainment" -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization. He entered Japan's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013. He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976, in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches, which would later pave the way for today's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests. Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products, from hot sauce to banks. The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 199
1. The FBI has confirmed that one of its most wanted terrorists, the Malaysian bomb maker known as Marwan, was killed in an otherwise disastrous raid in the Philippines in January. 2. Marwan, whose real name is Zulkifli bin Hir, was believed by the FBI to a member of southeast Asian terror group Jemaah Islamiyah's central command. 3. The FBI had been offering a $5 million reward for information leading to Marwan's capture in the wake of his 2007 indictment on terror charges in a California court. 4. The Philippines has been fighting an insurgency in the predominantly Muslim south for years, and last year signed a peace agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the largest rebel group in the region. 5. According to a report released by the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) last month, the BIFF faction sheltering Marwan had sworn allegiance to ISIS. 6. The IPAC report argued that the "single-minded focus" of authorities on killing Marwan has threatened the peace agreement with the MILF, which is yet to cross the final hurdle of being passed into law by the Philippines Congress. 7. The report argued that, although Marwan had aided terror attacks and provided funds and equipment to MILF and Abu Sayyaf, he was not "the master bomber that his reputation suggested." 8. Yet for the Philippines authorities and their U.S. allies, killing Marwan had become such a priority that security forces bypassed the mechanisms that had been established to alert the MILF to such operations, for fear of word leaking to their target. 9. The report quoted an anonymous Indonesian associate of Marwan's who described the Malaysian as "a little snake who has been blown up into a dragon." 10. The FBI expressed its "sincere condolences to the brave officers of the Special Action Force who lost their lives while attempting to apprehend this dangerous fugitive." 11. While an SAF superintendent said at a eulogy for the fallen commandos that their sacrifice had been worth it, controversy has dogged the botched mission in the Philippines. 12. The IPAC report argued that the Mamapasano fiasco was the result of a misguided emphasis on killing Marwan. 13. The report argued that, although Marwan had aided terror attacks and provided funds and equipment to MILF and Abu Sayyaf, he was not "the master bomber that his reputation suggested." 14. The best
 Shibuya ward, one of Tokyo's most famous shopping and trendy entertainment districts, has passed an ordinance paving the way for "partnership certificates" for same-sex couples, allowing them some of the rights of married heterosexual couples. Same-sex partners who are registered with the district's ward office will be able to hold visitation rights in hospitals and co-sign tenancy agreements. The certificates will not be issued until later in the summer and are not legally binding, but proponents of marriage equality in socially conservative Japan say that the ward's decision is a step in the right direction.  END OF DOCUMENT  The government of Shibuya ward, one of the capital's most famous shopping and trendy entertainment districts, passed ordinance on Wednesday paving the way for "partnership certificates" for same-sex couples, allowing them some of the rights of married heterosexual couples. Same-sex partners who are registered with the district's ward office will be able to hold visitation rights in hospitals and co-sign tenancy agreements. Other advantages that heterosexual married couples enjoy, such as joint filing of taxes, are controlled by the federal government and are outside the remit of individual municipalities. The measure was proposed in February by Shibuya's mayor, Toshitake Kuwahara. While the certificates will not be issued until later in the summer and are not legally binding, proponents of marriage equality in socially conservative Japan say that the ward's decision is a step in the right direction. "It is not a marriage license and advantages will be limited but still better than nothing," Gon Matsunaka, a gay rights activist, told CNN. While Shibuya's decision does not yet equate to heterosexual marriage, the hope is that the move will be the beginnings of promoting marriage equality for gay communities. "What is important for the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community in Shibuya is the ruling will make us visible in society," Matsunaka said. "It could be a strong driver for Shibuya citizens to learn and know what kind of problems LGBT people are facing." Taiga Ishikawa, Tokyo councillor and the first male gay local assembly member in Japan, told CNN the ordinance was a "big first step for the protection of human rights." He called the decision "happy" but said that it must go alongside education about alternative lifestyles. He said that the most important part of today's announcement is that it "should be actually put into practice, as should education for understanding (LGBT individuals) especially they suffer as they find out their sexuality when they are young

1. Six people were injured in an explosion at a chemical plant in China's southeastern Fujian province. 2. The plant produces paraxylene (PX), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics. 3. The blast occurred at an oil storage facility Monday night after an oil leak. 4. Local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill. 5. The plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time. 6. The construction of PX plants has sparked protests, which have occasionally turned violent, in several cities in recent years. 7. The Zhangzhou plant was slated for Xiamen -- a densely populated city in the southeast of the country. However, it provoked an angry backlash in 2007 due to pollution concerns and prompted the local government to relocate the factory to its current, more remote location. 8. More than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and the fire is now under control. 9. Five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment. 10. Residents living close to the plant had heard the explosion and took to Weibo to post photos of the fire. One user wrote that he heard a loud blast and felt slight tremors. 11.

1. A family of four fell ill after renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort in St. John. 2. The EPA was called in and found that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying. 3. Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage. 4. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. 5. The EPA is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. 6. The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into the matter. 7. The SEC filing described the injuries to the family members as "serious." 8. The family had rented the villa from March 14 to March 22. 9. The luxury villa where the family stayed rents between $550 and $1,200 per night. 10. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said that the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but that their unit was not treated. 11.

James Maron, an attorney who has been a spokesman for the family, has not responded to requests for comment. 15. The SEC filing described the injuries to the family members as "serious." 16. The EPA is actively working to determine how this happened and will make sure steps are taken to prevent this from happening to others at these vacation apartments or elsewhere. 17. Pesticides can be very toxic, and it is critically important that they be applied properly and used only as approved by EPA,"
 Rand Paul, who is running for president of the United States, is attempting to launch his campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation. Since coming to the U.S. Senate, Paul has tried to sell himself as a different type of Republican.  He's tried to brand himself as the GOP's minority outreach candidate.  The problem for Paul, and the GOP at large, is that they don't back up their words with their policies. Paul has also questioned the Civil Rights Act, and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate. When asked about the need for a more robust Voting Rights Act following the Supreme Court's dismantling of the law, Paul dismissively remarked, "We have an African-American President." Unfortunately Rand Paul has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle.  Paul tried once again from that stage in Louisville to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden Republican appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year. But his record makes it very clear that his views are outdated, outside of the mainstream, and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead our country. The American people deserve a leader who won't disrespect their intelligence, who won't pander to them when it's convenient, and who won't work to dismantle the progress we have made over the last five decades. What I heard today, didn't change the facts about Rand Paul's record.  The American people deserve better than Rand Paul.  The writer of the article is not impressed with Rand Paul's record and his attempt to launch his campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation. The writer believes that Paul's views are outdated, outside of the mainstream, and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead the country. The writer believes that the American people deserve a leader who won't disrespect their intelligence, who won't pander to them when it's convenient, and who won't work to dismantle the progress made over the last five decades.

 The US Department of Justice has named FedEx as a new defendant in the war on drugs, accusing the courier delivery service of conspiracies, transporting prescription pharmaceuticals dispensed with illegal prescriptions, violations of the Controlled Substances Act, misbranding charges, and money laundering charges. FedEx has responded by saying that it is innocent, and that it is a common carrier, performing the normal duties of a common carrier, because it is engaged in the business of transportation of property and it offers its services to the public generally. The company has a strong argument for dismissal in this case, but even if not, it won't be swapping its logo orange for prison orange anytime soon. 
1. Mad Men is a show about a 1960s advertising agency and its collision with changing times. 2. The show has become part of the national fabric, if never a huge ratings hit. 3. The end of a TV series brings with it some risk. 4. The last season ended with the moon landing in July 1969. 5. The show is generally a show about disintegration, reflective of the '60s themselves. 6. The old orders are falling apart. 7. Last season saw plenty of intraoffice turmoil. 8. Expect a number of longtime characters to look for an exit. 9. Roger Sterling might find an exit as well, but not one he's anticipating. 10. Peggy Olson's star has continued to rise. 11. Don's ex-wife, Betty, has lost herself amid all the turmoil. 12. Sally, Don's daughter, is proving to be a handful. 13. It's April 1, 1970. Richard Nixon is signing legislation banning cigarette ads on radio and television, reminding Don of the day 10 years earlier when he came up with the Lucky Strike campaign that began the series. 14. He'll fix himself a drink, ponder buying an avocado-colored refrigerator, clean out his ashtray and leave the show the way he arrived: on top of the zeitgeist, unable to accept his past and utterly, inscrutably alone.  The end of a TV series brings with it some risk. "The Sopranos," "Mad Men" creator Matthew Weiner's former employer, divided fans with its famous cut-to-black finale. On the other hand, "Mad Men's" former AMC stablemate, "Breaking Bad," was saluted for an almost perfect landing. Speaking of landings: The last season -- technically, the first half of season 7 -- ended with the moon landing in July 1969. Though Weiner and his cast have been typically tight-lipped -- Weiner even hid the finale from his cast at first -- it's reasonable to assume the new season will pick up soon afterward. What's going to happen? Here are some educated guesses. With the '60s screaming towards their conclusion, "Mad Men" probably won't jump ahead much. The latter half of 1969 included the Manson murders, the Woodstock festival, a New York mayoral campaign and the Vietnam War moratorium demonstrations -- plenty of fodder for the characters to interact with, if only tangentially
1. Chris Rock has tweeted about being stopped by the police three times in seven weeks. 2. Many African-Americans have long bemoaned the phenomenon of being pulled over for no apparent reason, calling it "driving while black." 3. Blacks are about 30% more likely to be pulled over by police than whites, according to figures reported by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2013. 4. Actor Isaiah Washington urged Rock to "#Adapt" to avoid racial profiling. "I sold my $90,000.00 Mercedes G500 and bought 3 Prius's, because I got tired of being pulled over by Police," Washington tweeted. 5. Years ago, Rock filmed a sketch for his "Chris Rock" show on HBO in which he detailed ways to avoid being beaten by police as a black man. Besides obeying the law, he suggested bringing a white friend along for the ride. He did just that last year in a segment of "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee" with Jerry Seinfeld. The two chat as Seinfeld drives an orange Lamborghini. And what happened? They get pulled over after Seinfeld goes a bit heavy on the gas. "Here's the crazy thing," Rock tells Seinfeld as the police officer stops the duo. "If you weren't here, I'd be scared." Correct Incorrect  Question 2 of 5 2 . Question Summarize the given document. Document: (CNN)The U.S. government is investigating whether airlines are colluding to keep ticket prices high. The Justice Department sent letters to American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines seeking information on whether they illegally signaled to each other how quickly they would add new flights, routes and extra seats. The government is trying to determine whether airlines are working together to keep airfares artificially high. The airlines said they are cooperating with the investigation. "We welcome the review as the airline industry has been subject to considerable consolidation, leaving four major airlines in control of over 80% of the domestic market," American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller said. The investigation comes as airlines are enjoying record profits thanks to low fuel prices and high demand. But passengers are not benefiting from the lower costs. The average domestic airfare rose to $396 in the fourth quarter of 2014, up 2.5% from the same period in 2013, according to the Department of Transportation. The government is also looking into whether airlines colluded to limit the number of available seats,

Correct Incorrect  Summarize the given document. Document: (CNN)The US military has begun testing a new type of missile that could be used to take out targets in North Korea, according to reports. The missile, known as the CHAMP (Counter-electronics High-powered Microwave Advanced Missile Project), is a non-lethal weapon that emits microwaves to fry electronics within range. The missile was tested last week at the Utah Test and Training Range, according to the Air Force Research Laboratory.

147 people were killed in a terrorist attack at Garissa University College in Kenya last week. Kenyans have used social media to share the victims' stories, hopes and dreams. The hashtag #147notjustanumber was used to tweet pictures of the victims in happier times. The attack killed 142 students, three security officers and two university security personnel, and was the nation's deadliest since the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 1998. The gunmen who attacked the university in the predawn hours separated Muslims from Christians and killed the latter. The extremist group has also killed Muslims in recent attacks. The Interior Ministry has identified one of the attackers killed by security forces as the son of a government official. The father of suspect Abdirahim Abdullahi is a chief in Mandera and had reported his son missing, officials said. The Islamist extremist group is based in Somalia, but it hasn't confined its terrorism to the nation that shares a border with Kenya.

 A couple relocating from Abu Dhabi to New York have lost their pet cat, Felix, after it went missing at JFK airport. The couple had booked Felix on an Etihad Airways flight from the United Arab Emirates to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on April 1. Shortly after the plane arrived in New York that evening, Felix went missing somewhere on the grounds of Kennedy Airport, according to Etihad Airways. Felix was able to get loose, Stewart said she believes, because the cat's plastic carrier was badly damaged at some point either during the flight or the transfer from the airplane to the pickup area. Nearly one week later, Felix remains missing. Etihad Airways is investigating the incident and is working with ground handlers at the New York airport to help locate the missing cat. The Abu Dhabi-based carrier also said it hired "third-party specialists" to help in the hunt for Felix. "We deeply regret this unfortunate incident and are keeping the owner apprised of the progress of the search," Etihad Airways told CNN in a statement. "We will review our pet handling procedures in the wake of this incident, as the safety and care of pets traveling with Etihad Airways is a top priority." Stewart and her husband booked the cat's flight as part of their job relocation to the United States after living in Abu Dhabi for more than three years. The couple said they spent $1,200 to ship Felix on the 14-hour flight. "You pay all of this money, but for what? People assume you pay extra to have your pets taken care of, but they're treated no differently than a free piece of checked luggage," Stewart said. It isn't the first time a pet has gone missing at New York's busiest airport. In August 2011, a cat escaped from its carrier before an American Airlines flight from New York to San Francisco. That cat was eventually discovered -- alive -- two months later in a customs room at the airport. But the cat later had to be euthanized because of injuries and malnutrition it suffered while lost. This weekend, Stewart enlisted the help of a local nonprofit, which provided a highly trained detection dog, to help track down Felix's scent. A wildlife biologist who works with the airport has also placed traps to facilitate Felix's safe return, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Officials at Kennedy have offered to assist Etihad Airways as the airline investigates what happened, the Port Authority said. Stewart said the couple will continue to search the airport until they have answers.

Document: (CNN)The world's largest airplane has been unveiled for the first time in California. The mega jet, which has a wingspan of 385 feet, was built by Stratolaunch Systems, founded by Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft. The plane is designed to carry rockets into the stratosphere, where they would then blast off into space. The aircraft is 238 feet long and stands 50 feet tall from the ground to the top of the tail. It has 28 wheels and is powered by six 747 engines. The plane is so big it requires two cockpits, one in each fuselage. The plane is designed to carry up to three rockets at a time, with a combined weight of 500,000 pounds. The rockets would be tethered to the belly of the aircraft, which would fly to an altitude of about 30,000 feet. The rockets would then drop, ignite their engines and launch into space. The plane is expected to take to the skies for the first time in 2016. Summary: 1. The world's largest airplane has been unveiled for the first time in California. 2.

 Easter is a unique holiday on the Christian calendar that has always been able to resist the commercialization and culture warring that surrounds Christmas. Easter Triduum refers to the three days of Easter that begin with Good Friday, proceed through Holy Saturday, and conclude with Easter Sunday. Maundy Thursday is the day when Jesus celebrated the Last Supper with his disciples in the upper room in Jerusalem on the night before he was crucified. Good Friday is the day of the crucifixion, when Jesus was scourged and beaten, forced to carry his cross to Golgotha, the "place of the skull," and nailed to the cross itself for what must have been an agonizing death. Holy Saturday is a passageway between the darkness of the crucifixion and the bright hope of Easter. Easter embraces the great mystery of resurrection, with its promise of transformation -- a shift from one form to another, and a change that moves well beyond any literal understanding. The three days of Easter, the Triduum, occur only once a year on the calendar. But the really interesting thing is that we all experience the pattern of the three days again and again. We find ourselves emptied out in small ways, nailed to our own trees in life, embarrassed or broken by life. It was the Buddha who famously observed that life is suffering. Good Friday embodies the Christian version of that truth. Jesus suffered in the way all of us must suffer. We must all die, perhaps less ignominiously but just as certainly. Our friends and families must die. We all experience illness, loss, sadness, a loss of confidence, darkness. This is simply part of the human experience. We dive again and again into Holy Saturday, too -- a period of transition, when the bleakness of suffering is perhaps slightly behind us but nothing restorative seems in view. We know well this in-between time; it's an anxious passage, with only a glimmer on the horizon of potential hope. And we've all been resurrected, again and again, perhaps in tiny ways. This is the joy of Easter, and it's not something reserved for one day on the calendar. It's there whenever we experience what T.S. Eliot once called the "timeless moment," which can only occur -- paradoxically -- in time itself. It's a mystical point where timelessness intersects with time. I suspect we all experience the Triduum frequently, sometimes more than once in a single day. But the ritual enactment of these three days of the Easter season reminds all
 The article discusses how Jesus and his disciples supported themselves during their travels. The article suggests that Jesus and his disciples lived at a subsistence level, relying on begging and hospitality to meet their basic needs. The article also suggests that Jesus and his followers may have received donations from supporters, including some wealthy people who were drawn to his ministry. The article notes that women whom Jesus had healed provided for him out of their "resources," with Mary Magdalene and Joanna being two of the most prominent. The article also suggests that men like Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, both men of stature and wealth, may have chipped in to help fund Jesus' ministry. After the resurrection, the movement Jesus started grew exponentially, and the church's relationship to money grew more complicated as the needs became greater.  Overall, the article suggests that Jesus and his followers relied on the generosity of others to support themselves and their mission.<|im_end|>
1. Massachusetts is hosting two of the highest-profile court trials in recent memory -- those of former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez and Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. 2. In Louisville, Kentucky, Sen. Rand Paul made the not-so-surprising announcement that he will run for president, while in Chicago, voters will head to the polls in a very surprising runoff between Mayor Rahm Emanuel and challenger Jesus "Chuy" Garcia. 3. And in Ferguson, Missouri, the shadow of Michael Brown and the protests over his shooting by Officer Darren Wilson will loom large over the city's elections. 4. The jury on Tuesday morning began what is expected to be a lengthy deliberation process on 30 total charges, before the so-called penalty phase, should he be found guilty on any counts. 5. Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday, and the jury will begin deliberations soon thereafter. 6. Paul is expected to hit the campaign trail visiting the all-important early voters in New Hampshire, South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada. 7. The physician rode a wave of tea party popularity into the Senate in 2010, where he carefully built a brand of mainstream libertarianism, and he is banking on a coalition of younger voters and traditional Republicans to usher him into the White House. 8. Paul and Sen. Ted Cruz are the only declared candidates for the GOP nomination, though the field will certainly grow and could include the likes of Florida's Jeb Bush, New Jersey's Chris Christie, Wisconsin's Scott Walker, South Carolina's Lindsey Graham and Florida's Marco Rubio. 9. In one corner, you have Emanuel, President Barack Obama's notoriously hard-charging former chief of staff, and in the other, you have Jesus "Chuy" Garcia, a county commissioner who has come to embody populist and liberal Democrats' frustrations with the Chicago incumbent. 10. Following Michael Brown's death, the national spotlight shone on Ferguson, particularly how the city's predominantly black population is woefully underrepresented in its police force and City Council. Yet with all the hubbub about the face of civic leadership, only four in 10 city residents hit the polls in November to cast ballots. Tuesday's election will bring change, no matter how the ballots are cast: Two black men are running for one of the open seats, and the current lone black council member isn't up for re-election. In another ward, two black women and two white men are vying for an open seat. And a white
1. Ted Cruz is the only official contender in the race for the Republican nomination for the US presidency. 2. He is counting on Iowa, known for its vocal and active evangelical base, to propel him forward in what's expected to be a tough competition among a crowded field of GOP candidates. 3. Cruz has built a brand as a stalwart conservative willing to buck GOP leadership on fiscal issues, but he showed in Iowa last week that he's also eager to champion social issues at a time when many Republicans are anxious to avoid them. 4. Cruz's first television ads are appearing this weekend during programs on Fox News and NBC that are pegged to Easter Sunday. In the ad, Cruz talks about the impact of the "transformative love of Jesus Christ" on his life. 5. Cruz frequently says he wants to see a return of the evangelical vote to 2004 levels, when more than six in 10 evangelicals voted in the presidential election, a higher than normal turnout for the demographic. 6. Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, said he expects to see record turnout among evangelicals in 2016 no matter who the nominee is or what that person says. 7. Later in April, voters in Iowa will see the bulk of the GOP field tackle these issues when they take the stage at an event hosted by the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition. 8. The past two winners of the Iowa caucuses -- Santorum and Huckabee -- are likely running for president again, but Steve Scheffler, president of the group, argued that the field is wide open in terms of who's going to win favor among evangelicals.   00:00 / 00:00  AUDIO: PODCAST  The US presidential race is now well underway, with Ted Cruz the first Republican to officially announce his candidacy. Cruz is a senator from Texas and a Tea Party favourite. He is also a devout Christian, and is hoping to win the support of the evangelical vote in the Republican primaries. Iowa is the first state to hold a primary, and is known for its vocal and active evangelical base. Cruz is counting on Iowa to propel him forward in what's expected to be a tough competition among a crowded field of GOP candidates. Evangelicals make up a large segment of Iowa's Republican voter bloc. According to a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll from January, 44% of likely 2016 Republican caucus-goers said they were born-again or

 China's former security czar, Zhou Yongkang, has been formally charged with accepting bribes, abuse of power and leaking state secrets, making him the highest-ranking Chinese Communist Party official ever to face corruption charges. Zhou was a member of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee, China's top decision-making body, and at the height of his power controlled police forces, spy agencies, court systems as well as prosecution offices across China. He retired in 2012. Zhou has not been seen in public since he attended an anniversary event at his alma mater in October 2013. He was expelled from the Communist Party and arrested last December.  His case will be tried in Tianjin, a city near the Chinese capital, Beijing.

 TV5Monde, a French-language global television network, has regained control of one of its 11 channels after a cyber attack crippled its broadcasts and social media accounts. The network lost control of its social media outlets and websites, and ISIS logos and markings appeared on TV5Monde social media accounts. The network said it was "hacked by an Islamist group," but there was no immediate claim of responsibility by ISIS or any other group.

21 year old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been found guilty of all 30 counts he faced in the Boston Marathon bombing trial. 17 of the 30 counts were capital charges, meaning he is eligible for the death penalty. The trial will next move into a penalty phase, where the jury will hear testimony and arguments from both sides and ultimately be tasked with deciding whether Tsarnaev will be executed. Since testimony began March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. Tsarnaev's defense attorney Judy Clarke tried to convince jurors that her client's older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack, was the instigator of the marathon plot. The younger man, Clarke said, was only following his older brother. After the verdict, CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said Clarke now faces an uphill battle. "Because No. 1, he (Tsarnaev) is almost functioning as an officer of a military organization attacking the United States -- the claim of course that he's an Islamic radical and that this is almost an army-like attack on civilians. "And the second thing -- it was so well planned and so callously planned so that civilians would die, so that children would be maimed. And all of this, she has to get around and convince the jury he's not worthy of the death penalty. "Boy, she's climbing the Mount Everest of death penalty cases in this case," Callan said about Clarke.   00:00 / 00:00  Reuters reports that the jury will now hear evidence in a second phase of the trial to determine whether Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death or life in prison without possibility of parole. The penalty phase is expected to last several weeks.  The Boston Marathon bombing killed three people and injured 264 others. Tsarnaev was also found guilty of killing an MIT police officer three days later.  The verdict was announced after the jury deliberated for 11 and a half hours over two days. Tsarnaev was found guilty of all 30 charges against him, including conspiracy and use of a weapon of mass destruction.  The trial began on March 4 and the prosecution called 92 witnesses, while the defence called just four. The defence had argued that Tsarnaev was under the influence of his older brother, Tamerlan, who was killed in a shootout with police.  The defence team had also

"Half the town is gone," said the mayor of Amatrice, Sergio Pirozzi. "There are people under the rubble... There's been a landslide and a bridge might collapse." The earthquake hit around 3:30 a.m. local time (9:30 p.m. Tuesday ET) about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) southeast of Norcia, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). It was shallow -- only 10 kilometers deep -- which amplified its effect. The mayor of nearby Accumoli, Stefano Petrucci, described desperate scenes as rescuers raced against time to try to save trapped residents. "We're digging, digging... hoping to find someone alive," he told Rai TV. "It's very difficult." The earthquake was felt as far away as Rome, with some saying it lasted around 20 seconds. "The whole bed was shaking," Lina Mercantini of Ceselli, Umbria, about 75 kilometers from the epicenter, told Reuters. "It was like a train in motion, a terrible noise." Summary: 1.

1. The California Public Utilities Commission has ordered Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to pay a record $1.6 billion penalty for unsafe operation of its gas transmission system, including the pipeline rupture that killed eight people in San Bruno in September 2010. 2. Most of the penalty amounts to forced spending on improving pipeline safety. Of the $1.6 billion, $850 million will go to "gas transmission pipeline safety infrastructure improvements," the commission said. Another $50 million will go toward "other remedies to enhance pipeline safety," according to the commission. 3. The company's chief executive officer said in a written statement that PG&E is working to become the safest energy company in the United States. "Since the 2010 explosion of our natural gas transmission pipeline in San Bruno, we have worked hard to do the right thing for the victims, their families and the community of San Bruno," Tony Earley said. "We are deeply sorry for this tragic event, and we have dedicated ourselves to re-earning the trust of our customers and the communities we serve. The lessons of this tragic event will not be forgotten." 4. On September 9, 2010, a section of PG&E pipeline exploded in San Bruno, killing eight people and injuring more than 50 others. The blast destroyed 37 homes. PG&E said it has paid more than $500 million in claims to the victims and victims' families in San Bruno, which is just south of San Francisco. 5. The company also said it has already replaced more than 800 miles of pipe, installed new gas leak technology and implemented nine of 12 recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board. 6. According to its website, PG&E has 5.4 million electric customers and 4.3 million natural gas customers. The Los Angeles Times reported the previous record penalty was a $146 million penalty against Southern California Edison Company in 2008 for falsifying customer and worker safety data. 7.

 Multiple tornadoes ripped through the rural Midwest on Thursday. A large and dangerous twister tore across fields in Iowa. And a twister touched down 70 miles outside of St. Louis. Eight tornadoes were reported Wednesday in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, the Storm Prediction Center said. But it appears residents have been fortunate enough to come away from the terrifying weather spectacle alive. Hail stones the size of tennis balls plummeted down on Ashton, Illinois. It could have been worse as severe tornado damage dotted a path not far from the dense populations of Chicago and Rockford -- the state's third largest city.  The tornado cut a 22-mile path through Ogle County, according to disaster management coordinator Tom Richter. North of Rochelle, a tornado took away a local favorite restaurant -- Grubsteakers.  "I have not been able to get a hold of him, Olson said, "but I know he's in touch with the sheriff and is safe," she said. Sheriff Brian VanVickle told journalists late Thursday that the tornado had spared life and limb in Ogle County aside from some people whose injuries were easily treatable. The county lost 20 homes -- one of them was his own. Fifty to 100 houses had significant damage, he said. Only foundations remained of some homes, said storm chaser Dan Gottschalk. "You can hear the hissing everywhere from where the structures used to be," he said. Lindsey Clark, a reporter from CNN affiliate WREX, said rescuers were pulling trapped people from a home in the Rochelle area. VanVickle was newly elected sheriff of Rochelle on Wednesday. On Thursday, the storm took his house and his sister-in-law's. "I've got the clothes on my back," he said. But his family wasn't at home when it hit. "My family was on the way to Louisville, dog was in the basement and she survived." It was the first tornado the sheriff had ever seen in his county. "I've lived here all my life, am the fifth generation in the county.  My mom said this is the first time she's ever seen a tornado." He is thankful that the National Weather Service warned one could come. That saved lives, he believes. The service warned of a "particularly dangerous situation." People across the Midwest should be on alert for severe weather. Tornado watches were set to run out early Friday. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Catherine Shoichet, Greg Botelho, Dave
1. A video showing white North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager shooting to death an unarmed black man has exposed discrepancies in the reports of the first officers on the scene. 2. Slager has been fired and charged with murder in the death of 50-year-old Walter Scott. 3. A bystander's cell phone video, which began after an alleged struggle on the ground between Slager and Scott, shows the five-year police veteran shooting at Scott eight times as Scott runs away. 4. Scott was hit five times. 5. If words were exchanged between the men, they're are not audible on the tape. 6. It's unclear what happened before Scott ran, or why he ran. 7. The officer initially said that he used a Taser on Scott, who, Slager said, tried to take the weapon. 8. Before Slager opens fire, the video shows a dark object falling behind Scott and hitting the ground. It's unclear whether that is the Taser. 9. Later in the video, when Slager approaches Scott's body, Slager appears to drop a dark object near Scott. 10. Feidin Santana, the witness who recorded the video, said he didn't see Scott grab Slager's Taser. His account contradicts what Slager told dispatchers. 11. In two interviews with NBC, Santana said that he was walking to his job in North Charleston on Saturday morning when he saw Slager chase Scott, who had been pulled over for a broken taillight. 12. Santana told NBC's Lester Holt on Wednesday that he saw the two men struggling on the ground. 13. "They were down on the (ground) ... before I started recording," Santana said. "I remember the police (officer) had control of the situation. He had control of Scott." 14. Santana said he heard the sound of a Taser being used. He believed Scott was trying to get away from it. But Scott never got the Taser or used it on the officer, Santana told NBC. 15. The North Charleston Police Department is not providing additional information, citing an ongoing investigation of Scott's killing by the independent South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. 16. North Charleston Police Chief Eddie Driggers was asked at a news conference this week whether CPR was performed on Scott. "I do not know. I was told that life-saving ... that they tried to save his life," Driggers said. North Charleston Mayor Keith Summ

 The Secret Service is facing yet another scandal as a female employee has accused Xavier Morales, a supervisor within the agency, of assault after he made sexual advances at her. Morales was placed on administrative leave and his security clearance was suspended. This is just the latest chapter for an organization embroiled in scandal over the past several months. Last month, two top-ranking officials were suspended following an incident at a White House command post during an investigation of a possible bomb. Clancy was not made aware of the episode until five days later. The agency has also faced scrutiny for another lapse in late January when a drone crash-landed on the White House lawn. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson resigned in September after a fence-jumper gained access to the East Room of the White House. An independent report released in December found that the Secret Service is stretched "beyond its limits," needing more training, more staff, and a director from outside its ranks. Clancy, who formally assumed the post in February, is a 27-year veteran of the agency. The incident will be further investigated by the Office of the Inspector General.

58 year old Anthony Ray Hinton has been released from Alabama's death row after nearly 30 years for murders he says he didn't commit. Hinton was convicted of murder in the 1985 deaths of two Birmingham-area, fast-food restaurant managers, John Davidson and Thomas Wayne Vason. But a new trial was ordered in 2014 after firearms experts testified 12 years earlier that the revolver Hinton was said to have used in the crimes could not be matched to evidence in either case, and the two killings couldn't be linked to each other. The state then declined to re-prosecute the case. Hinton was accompanied Friday by two of his sisters, one of whom still lives in the Birmingham area. Other siblings will fly to the area to see him soon, Stevenson said. His mother, with whom he lived at the time of his arrest, is no longer living, according to the lawyer. Hinton planned to spend at least this weekend at the home of a close friend. He will meet with his attorneys Monday to start planning for his immediate needs, such as obtaining identification and getting a health checkup, Stevenson said. The plan now is to spend a few weeks to get oriented with freedom and "sort out what he wants to do," Stevenson said. 1. What is the name of the man who has been released from Alabama's death row? 2.
