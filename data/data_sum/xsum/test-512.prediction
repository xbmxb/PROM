70 years ago, HMS Hebe was deployed to Dover as a control vessel during the evacuation of Dunkirk. The ship crossed the Channel to Dunkirk three times during those chaotic days between 27 May and 4 June. The German bombardment, the trauma and the fatigue were taking a toll on the crew of HMS Hebe, and no doubt other ships involved in the evacuation. On the morning of 1 June, my father witnessed the first signs of what we now know to be post-traumatic stress, but in those days was sometimes referred to as a "lack of moral fibre". The captain of the Hebe sent for Harold Biles as the Chief Engineer, and the Coxswain. They both had to tell him that the ship was so depleted of crew that a further sailing was impossible. And so they remained alongside while other craft made the trip, some never to return. To my father's dismay, HMS Hebe played no further part in Operation Dynamo.<|im_end|>

1965 track Tears by Ken Dodd was the third biggest-selling single of the decade, according to a newly compiled chart. The Beatles occupy the top two places in the chart and have an additional three records in the Top 10. DJ Tony Blackburn counted down the Top 60 best-selling records of the 1960s in a special programme on BBC Radio Two, broadcast on Bank Holiday Monday. According to sales data compiled by the Official Charts Company, the biggest selling single of the 1960s was She Loves You by The Beatles. I Want to Hold Your Hand, recorded by the Fab Four in 1963, came second. The other Beatles records in the Top 10 are Can't Buy Me Love at four, I Feel Fine at five and the double A-side We Can Work It Out/Day Tripper at seven. Dodd's track - which topped the UK singles chart for five weeks and was the biggest-selling single of 1965 - outsold them all. Jeff Smith, Radio 2's head of music, called the chart "a nostalgic reflection of the enduring appeal of the music of the '60s and the artists that defined the decade." Dodd, now 82, has been in showbusiness for more than 50 years. Born in Liverpool in 1927, he is best known for his buck teeth and frizzy hair, tickling stick and his creation of the Diddymen. 1.

373,782 customers visited Scotland's five mountain resorts since late November, with the ski season estimated to have attracted £37.5m into the local economy. CairnGorm Mountain expects skiing during the first weekend of June. Recent figures from Ski Scotland showed that this season's figures were better than the last bumper season of 2000-2001. For every pound spent on the slopes another £3 is spent in the local economy with more than £28m being spent this winter in local accommodation, cafés, bars, restaurants, shops and filling stations. Ms Negus added: "All the ski areas have been delighted to see other local businesses thriving this winter." Everything really came together for us - we had lots and lots of superb snow, which kept on coming, some truly amazing overhead weather giving 'bluebird' conditions, and, because there was also snow elsewhere in the UK, people realised that the Scottish Highlands did have skiing and snow boarding to rival the best and they came here to enjoy it." 2.

 Five former Argentine military officers have gone on trial in Buenos Aires accused of crimes against humanity. They are accused of kidnapping, torturing, and killing left-wing activists under the country's military rule between 1976 and 1983. Human rights groups hope the trial will shed light on Operation Condor, a joint effort among South American military rulers aimed at suppressing opposition. The five have denied the charges. A sixth man, former Vice Cmdr Nestor Guillamondegui, was excused from the trial on health grounds, court officials said. They said his health would be monitored to determine if he could face trial at a later date. The men are accused of having run a notorious detention centre in Buenos Aires. More than 200 people are believed to have been kidnapped and taken to the secret prison, known as Automotores Orletti. Most of the detained were from Uruguay, but survivors say it also housed prisoners from Chile, Paraguay, Bolivia and Cuba. Condor was devised in 1975 by military officials from Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay. Its aim was to silence the opposition by sending teams into other countries to track, monitor and kill dissidents. A prosecutor said what happened at Automotores Orletti was "calculated and planned and amounted to a death sentence" for the prisoners. Marcelo Gelman, the son of Argentine poet Juan Gelman, was one of those detained in the clandestine prison in 1976. His body was later found in a cement-filled drum dumped in a river. His wife, Maria Claudia Garcia, was pregnant when she was abducted. She was taken to Uruguay, where she was disappeared. Their daughter, Macarena Gelman, was raised by a police officer in Uruguay. She says she will testify at the trial, which is expected to last months.  The trial of five former Argentine military officers accused of crimes against humanity has begun in Buenos Aires.

50 years ago Harper Lee wrote the classic novel To Kill a Mockingbird. It remains the only novel she ever wrote. Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. "She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. "And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the "conflict of the human soul" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a "fuzzy-cheeked young preacher" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. "The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book," the Rev Butts told me. "The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them." Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skil
50,000 people are being recruited for the Scottish Family Health Study, which aims to investigate why diseases such as cancer can run in families. Those recruited will have their health tracked, with the intention of creating a Scottish "bio-bank" containing genetic, medical and family history and lifestyle information. This will allow researchers to investigate the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to common conditions. The data gathered will help future research into the prevention, treatment and diagnosis of illnesses. 3. What is the Scottish Family Health Study?

1733 portrait of Gambian Ayuba Suleiman Diallo, by artist William Hoare, has gone on show at the London gallery. The Heritage Lottery Fund, The Art Fund and the NPG will all contribute to the total cost, which is £555,000. Diallo was captured as a slave in Africa at the age of 29 and was transported to work on a plantation in America. After he was imprisoned for trying to escape, he met lawyer Thomas Bluett who, impressed by Diallo's intellect and education, took him to England. The National Portrait Gallery said Hoare's painting was the first British portrait that honoured a named African subject as an individual and an equal. The painting had sold at auction in Christie's in London in December for £554,937.50. The Heritage Lottery Fund and The Art Fund have already given grants of £333,000 and £100,000, while the NPG has also contributed. The Lottery Fund's grant will go towards the acquisition, as well as the costs of conserving, displaying and touring the painting around other galleries and museums in the UK. 2.

1. The UK government has won a vote in the House of Commons to increase the rate of VAT from 17.5% to 20% from January 2011. 2. The increase is expected to raise Â£13bn towards reducing the Â£155bn deficit. 3. The move was controversial as the Conservatives said they had "no plans" to raise it during the election while the Lib Dems attacked the Tories - now their now-coalition partners - saying their plans would necessitate a "VAT bombshell". 4. Neither the Conservatives, Labour nor the Lib Dems ruled out raising VAT before the general election. 5. A proposed amendment to the Finance Bill by the SNP and Plaid Cymru, which would have prevented the increase, was defeated by a majority of 295. 6. A Labour-backed amendment calling for the move to be delayed pending an assessment of its impact on vulnerable groups was also defeated. 7. MPs approved the VAT rise by 321 to 246, a government majority of 75. 8. Treasury minister David Gauke said VAT was "one of the few levers available" to the government to address the shortfall in the public finances. "Any sensible government would consider it. And, given the circumstances we're in, any government would do it." He added: "We had to raise VAT because there was no money left." 9. Shadow chancellor Alistair Darling confirmed Labour had looked at raising VAT to 18% or 19% and said he did "not have a philosophic problem with that" as long as "you do something to help people on low fixed incomes" like pensioners and to ease the effect of spending cuts. 10. Labour's amendment was not a "blanket refusal to put up VAT" but a "reasoned and considered amendment" which was calling on the government to do more to help those worst hit by a VAT rise. 11. Britain's pensioners may face "an Â£8bn VAT bill over the course of this Parliament". 12. The SNP amendment was defeated by 316 votes to 21. Another Labour amendment, which was also defeated, would have exempted groups such as charities, local authorities and other groups from the VAT rise. 13. A Lib Dem MP, Andrew George, tabled an amendment to peg the rise to just 0.5% - from 17.5% to 18%. 14. The votes came during a

6 shots were fired at police during a third night of violence in north Belfast on Tuesday. Petrol bombs and a pipe bomb were also thrown by nationalist rioters in the Ardoyne area. About 100 officers used water cannon and baton rounds. The prime minister has said the PSNI behaved in a brave and restrained way during the recent trouble. Speaking in the Commons, Prime Minister David Cameron described the violence as "unacceptable" and said the PSNI had been forced to respond. On Wednesday, Assistant Chief Constable Duncan McCausland said children as young as 10 were involved in the violence. He said as well as throwing stones and petrol bombs, young children were being used as shields by "sinister elements" organising the riots behind them. ACC McCausland said police had hours of video footage from before the violence started and would use it to identify the rioters. "There will be significant arrests in the forthcoming days - individuals will not go scot free," he said. The rioter who dropped a concrete block on a policewoman on Monday night - seriously injuring her - had already been identified he added. "Wherever he is in Northern Ireland he can sit and be worried - we will be coming for him," he said. The officer is due to get out of hospital later on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the NI first and deputy first ministers have met the chief constable. Following the meeting, Peter Robinson said he had "nothing but the highest admiration for the way the police has dealt with the difficulties of recent days". Martin McGuinness described the violence as a "setback against the huge progress we have made in recent times". But he insisted that those behind the violence "would not succeed" in disrupting the political process. The NI Chief Constable, Matt Baggott, said his force was determined to bring those responsible to justice. Mr Robinson and Mr McGuinness were criticised on Tuesday by Assistant Chief Constable Alistair Finlay, who called on them to provide more leadership. On Wednesday, searches were carried out in the Ardoyne area in relation to the recent trouble and a number of items were taken away for further examination. A 20-year-old man was also charged with riotous behaviour in connection with an incident during an Orange Order march in the Ormeau Road area on 12 July. He is due to appear at Belfast Magistrates Court on Thursday. On Tuesday night in Ardoyne, burning barricades were put in place and laser pens were shone at police. Some officers suffered
1. The former head of MI5, Baroness Manningham-Buller, has told the Iraq inquiry that the UK's involvement in the Iraq war "undoubtedly increased" the terrorist threat to the UK. 2. She said that the terrorist threat to the UK from al-Qaeda and other groups "pre-dated" the Iraq invasion and also the 9/11 attacks in the US. 3. She said that the action had radicalised "a few among a generation" and that she was not "surprised" that UK nationals were involved in the 7/7 bombings in London. 4. She said she believed the intelligence on Iraq's threat was not "substantial enough" to justify the action. 5. She said she had advised officials a year before the war that the threat posed by Iraq to the UK was "very limited", and she believed that assessment had "turned out to be the right judgement". 6. She said the terrorist threat to the UK from al-Qaeda and other groups "pre-dated" the Iraq invasion and also the 9/11 attacks in the US. 7. She said MI5 did not "foresee the degree to which British citizens would become involved" in terrorist activity after 2004. 8. She said MI5 was given a budget increase after 9/11 and again in 2002 but the agency still needed far greater resources as a result of the Iraq invasion. 9. She said the Iraq war heightened the extremist view that the West was trying to bring down Islam. 10. She said MI5's responsibility was to collect and analyse intelligence and to "act on it where necessary" to mitigate terrorist threats, but stressed it was not her job "to fill in gaps" in the intelligence. 11. A year before the war, the former MI5 chief advised Home Office officials that the direct threat posed by Iraq to the UK was "very limited and containable". 12. In a newly declassified document, published by the inquiry, Baroness Manningham-Buller told the senior civil servant at the Home Office in March 2002 that there was no evidence that Iraq had any involvement in the 9/11 attacks. 13. In his evidence in January, Tony Blair described Saddam Hussein as a "monster" and said the world was a safer place with him no longer in control of Iraq. 14. The Chilcot inquiry is continuing to hear evidence about decisions taken in the build-up
 The Gaia satellite will be sent far from Earth to map the positions of more than a billion stars in our galaxy. Remarkable sensitivity should also enable the observatory to see hundreds of thousands of new celestial objects, including previously unknown planets. The main structure of the spacecraft was moved this week from the UK factory where it has been for a year to undergo tests on its propulsion system. EADS Astrium in Stevenage transported Gaia by road to Ampac-ISP at Aylesbury for checks on its cold gas micro-thrusters.  Once this work is complete, the structure will then go to Astrium's Toulouse, France, facility for final preparations. The European Space Agency (Esa) satellite is due for launch in 2012 on a Soyuz rocket from the new Sinnamary spaceport in French Guiana. Gaia is a successor to Europe's Hipparcos space astrometry mission which ran in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  It catalogued more than 100,000 stars in our galaxy. The new mission is a step change in capability, however.  Its billion-pixel camera system will give scientists an unprecedented 3D map of the sky. Over a five-year period, it will chart the precise positions, distances, movements, luminosities, and changes in brightness of stars.  These details will unlock new information about the structure, origin and evolution of our Milky Way Galaxy. And because Gaia will track anything that passes across its field of vision, it is likely also to see countless objects that had hitherto gone unrecorded - such as asteroids, planets beyond our Solar System, and tepid stars that never quite fired into life. What you see in the image at the top of this page is Gaia's electrical and service module. This is the part of the satellite that will do all of the "housekeeping" in space. It contains elements such as the attitude and orbit control system, the avionics, the computer and data handling subsystems. A large antenna will go underneath the structure to allow Gaia to talk to Earth. What you do not see here is the payload module that will eventually go on top.  This will be the unit that contains Gaia's telescopes and camera system. Nor do you see the thermal shield which will open - petal-like - from the underside of the service module to give protection to Gaia's sensitive optics.  The Gaia satellite will be sent far from Earth to map
1. Prince Charles and Camilla visited Brixton to see the work which has started to revitalise the borough. 2. Camilla bought a box of mangoes with a Brixton Â£10 note. 3. Greengrocer Derek Chong, who has run a stall on Electric Avenue for 20 years, said Camilla had been "nice and pleasant" when she purchased the fruit. 4. Prince Charles spent time talking to youth worker Marcus West, who works with children nearby on an estate off Coldharbour Lane. 5. Prince Charles also visited the Railway Hotel, at the invitation of his charity The Prince's Regeneration Trust. The trust hopes to restore and refurbish the building, where once Jimi Hendrix and The Clash played, as a new community and business centre.  Q: What is the Brixton Pound?  The Brixton Pound is a local currency used in the Brixton area of London. It was introduced in 2009 to encourage people to shop locally and support independent businesses. Customers can exchange traditional pound coins for Brixton Pounds and then spend them at the market or in participating shops. The currency is accepted by over 200 local businesses and can be used to pay for goods and services, including food, drink, clothing, and entertainment.  Q: What is the Prince's Regeneration Trust?  The Prince's Regeneration Trust is a charity founded by Prince Charles in 2006. Its mission is to save and restore historic buildings and sites in the UK that are at risk of being lost or neglected. The trust works with local communities, businesses, and government agencies to develop sustainable regeneration projects that create jobs, boost the local economy, and improve the quality of life for residents. Some of the trust's notable projects include the restoration of the St Pancras Renaissance Hotel in London and the Middleport Pottery in Stoke-on-Trent.  Q: What is the significance of the Railway Hotel in Brixton?  The Railway Hotel is a historic building in Brixton that was once a popular music venue. It hosted performances by famous artists such as Jimi Hendrix and The Clash in the 1960s and 70s. However, the building has been vacant for many years and is in a state of disrepair. The Prince's Regeneration Trust hopes to restore and refurbish the building as a new community and business centre, which will provide much-needed facilities and services for local residents and businesses. The project is part of the trust's wider
600 years ago, Zheng He, the Three-Jewel Eunuch Admiral, set sail from China on seven epic voyages, reaching south-east Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. He carried gifts from the Chinese emperor aboard his "treasure ship", which groaned with valuable cargo including gold, porcelain and silks. These were exchanged along the established Arab trade routes for ivory, myrrh and even China's first giraffe, promoting recognition of the new Ming dynasty. But within years of his death, Zheng appeared to fade from public consciousness, and for centuries his legend was overlooked as China turned its back on the world and entered a long period of isolation. Now Zheng is enjoying a resurgence - and there appears to be more than historical curiosity behind his revival. The sunken ship is believed to have been part of Zheng's armada, which reached the coastal town of Malindi in 1418. The Chinese seem confident they will find the wreck near the Lamu archipelago, where pieces of Ming-era ceramics have already surfaced. The Chinese government is investing Â£2m ($3m) in the three-year joint project, which Kenya says it hopes will throw up important findings about early relations between China and Africa. Analysts say this ties in well with China's diplomatic overtures to African nations, as it goes about securing natural resources and political influence. Zheng He - also known as Cheng Ho - is being hailed anew as a national hero; invoked by the Communist Party as a pioneer of China's "open-door" policies that have once again made China a world power. "The rise of China has induced a lot of fear," says Geoff Wade of the Institute of South-east Asian Studies in Singapore. "Zheng is being portrayed as a symbol of China's openness to the world, as an envoy of its peace and friendship - these two words keep cropping up in virtually every reference to Zheng He out of China," says Prof Wade. Zheng He was an admiral in the time of "empire", when there were no boundaries, no frontier limits, says China expert Edward Friedman. "The expeditions were real events - Zheng's achievements were extraordinary and a marvel of the time," says Prof Friedman of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. But the detail of Zheng's story is open to interpretation, and the version being promoted by the Chinese government ignores history in order to serve foreign policy, he says. Statesman Deng Xiaoping, regarded as the chief architect of China's "opening up" in the 198
1. The works on Gdynia Way near Plymouth's city centre have been in place since June to widen the road to three lanes. 2. Police said they had seen an increase in the number of collisions on the Maxwell Road, Macadam Road junction. 3. Plymouth City Council (PCC) said a new set of temporary traffic lights would be put on the junction. 4. Pc Ian Tanner, Plymouth's road casualty reduction officer said: "There have been some collisions since the new system was put in place, with four or five injury collisions in that area." 5. The council are diverting quite large volumes of traffic on to roads that, although perfectly up to the job, people don't usually travel on, and as a result it hasn't worked as well as we would have liked it to." 6. Pc Tanner added that the increase in collisions could also be a result of drivers, familiar with the route, not reading new signs properly. 7. In a statement, PCC said: "During the last couple of months it has become apparent that there could be further improvements to the revised junction layout." 8. The decision to install temporary lights has been made after routine discussions with various stakeholders including the police." 9. The lights will reinforce the changed priorities and help drivers negotiate this junction." 10. The council said that up to 1,000 drivers used the junction each hour. 11. The new traffic lights will give priority to traffic travelling between Plymstock and the city centre in the morning and vice versa in the evening, until the work is completed in October.

1. The Curriculum for Excellence is a new curriculum for children between the ages of three and 18. 2. It aims to focus more on teaching methods rather than content, and seeks to make young people more resourceful and responsible. 3. The system will be introduced for children in their first year of secondary school, and will be rolled out year on year until it is implemented for all secondary years. 4. Some teachers, unions and opposition parties have expressed concern the curriculum is not ready. 5. Scottish ministers have given assurances it will improve standards. 6. Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dems have raised concerns that the new curriculum is still too vague and have questioned whether enough funding has been made available to deliver it. 7. Some unions have expressed concerns that their members will not be ready to introduce the new system and pledged to create specialist groups in subject areas to provide the right support. 8. The Liberal Democrats said they supported the curriculum but said Mr Russell's handling of the situation was "shambolic". 9. Education Secretary Mike Russell said the current system was not being largely re-written. 10. Mr Russell said he had written to the parents of each child affected by the new system, and he had been visiting schools around the country to speak to parents and teachers. 11. Eleanor Coner of the Scottish Parent Teacher Council told BBC Scotland that although related exams are still a few years off, parents are concerned about the lack of communication over the new curriculum. 12. In March, Mr Russell rejected calls by secondary teachers to delay the introduction of the curriculum. 13. Labour education spokesman Des McNulty claimed SNP cuts were a threat to the new curriculum. 14. The vital materials and information needed for the successful implementation of the Curriculum for Excellence has not yet been provided and many teachers feel the support they were promised has not been delivered by the SNP. 15. The Liberal Democrats said they supported the curriculum but said Mr Russell's handling of the situation was "shambolic". 16. Education spokeswoman Margaret Smith said: "I'm pleased that teachers are excited about teaching the new curriculum, but as children return to school today, there are still no criteria for the new national exams replacing Standard Grades."Teachers have to start teaching the new curriculum, but with no idea about the exams that they should be preparing children for." 17. Speaking on BBC radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Russell said, "We already know that in the primary sector, this is a
 Sir Philip Green, the owner of clothing retailer Arcadia Group, has been appointed by the UK government to lead a review of public spending.

1. The keynote MacTaggart Lecture will be given by the director general of the BBC, Mark Thompson, at what is a crucial time for the corporation. 2. Last year during the keynote Edinburgh speech, one of the BBC's biggest competitors, James Murdoch, launched an outspoken attack on the corporation. 3. He called its "dominant" scale "chilling" and said that it should be "far, far smaller". 4. The BSkyB chairman - who also runs much of News Corporation, the publisher of The Times, Sunday Times, Sun and the News of the World - expressed particular concern over the public funding of the BBC's news output, which he called "state-sponsored journalism". 5. He claimed it was a "threat to the plurality and independence of news provision", because it made it hard for commercial publishers to earn money from their own news websites. 6. To some of his audience, the idea of "state-sponsored journalism" was over the top. 7. But, worryingly for the BBC, Murdoch's general point that the corporation was too big and was harming its commercial rivals, drew murmurs of agreement from other media owners and politicians. 8. Since then, the BBC has found itself under almost constant fire, not least in the newspapers which now compete with it, as they extend their businesses onto the internet. 9. In this year's MacTaggart Lecture, Mr Thompson must try to win round the corporation's critics, including some of those commercial rivals and politicians. 10. But he must also set out his vision for the BBC, as a publicly-funded news and cultural organisation in a world of rapidly changing technology and behaviour - and tighter public finances. 11. The BBC has been widely criticised for the large sums of licence fee money it pays to its stars and top managers. 12. In the new age of public austerity, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt says much needs changing at the BBC. 13. He has given notice that the next licence fee negotiations - when they begin in a year's time - will be very tough. 14. Viewers, he says, can expect to pay less. 15. Belatedly, the BBC has responded to some of the criticisms. 16. Senior executives' pay has been published, then frozen, and bonuses withdrawn. 17. The highest-paid managers are giving up a month's pay for the next two years and will be asked to withdraw from a scheme which tops up their pensions.

 The trial of Andal Ampatuan Junior, accused of orchestrating the murder of 57 unarmed civilians, is about much more than establishing the guilt or innocence of one man, or even one family. It's about the huge influence of clans like the Ampatuans, and the culture of impunity surrounding them. While their involvement in the massacre has yet to be proven, there is no doubt whatsoever that the Ampatuans were - and still are - extremely powerful. The Ampatuans have been in Maguindanao for centuries, and can trace their lineage to a Muslim preacher, Shariff Aguak, who was one of the first people to bring the Islamic faith to the area. But they were not always the dominant force they are today. According to Arnold Esguerra, a history professor at the University of the Philippines in Manila, the surname Ampatuan only started to appear in official documents in the early part of the 20th Century. At that stage they were influential traders, he said - but their social status was definitely beneath that of the "datus", the traditional clan rulers. The situation changed in the mid-1970s, when then-President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law, and tried to stamp out the growing Islamic separatist movement by selecting a few people he could trust to administer the province. One of those people was Andal Ampatuan Junior's father, Andal Senior, who is now the undisputed head of the family clan. First, he became the mayor of Maganoy town - and then, during the presidency of Cory Aquino, he was given the more powerful role of officer-in-charge. But it was under President Gloria Arroyo, who came to power in 2001, when the Ampatuans really came to prominence. Andal Senior became governor of Maguindanao, a post he has now held for the maximum three terms. Then in 2005 his son Zaldy became the governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao - an influential post controlling the five Muslim provinces that have been given a degree of self-rule from central government. 'Heights of power' Andal Junior became mayor of Datu Unsay, a town that bears his nickname, and at the time of the massacre, 10 of Maguindanao's 34 municipalities were run by Ampatuans or their relatives. Mrs Arroyo's government was good to the Ampatuans, providing funds for the region, and in the process propelling
80% of children in England who eat school lunches have tried food at school that they have not tried at home, according to a survey of 1,000 parents by the School Food Trust. Half of parents said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home. The most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn and peas, while aubergine, chickpeas and spinach were among the least popular. The survey was commissioned after a survey by the Mumsnet website suggested some parents gave their children packed lunches because they thought they were too fussy to eat anything else. About four in 10 primary school children in England now eat school lunches, slightly more than in secondary schools. More children in Scotland eat school lunches - about 46%. School meals in England now have to comply with strict nutritional guidelines. 0 Comments to School lunches encourage children to try new foods: Comments RSS Add a Comment Your Name:  Email Address: (Required)  Website:  Comment:

 The father of UK Prime Minister David Cameron has died after suffering a stroke and heart complications. Ian Cameron, 77, was born with both legs deformed, and endured repeated operations in an attempt to straighten them and ease his pain. Despite his disability he forged a successful career as a stockbroker and is a former director of estate agent John D Wood. David Cameron said before the general election that his father was a "glass half-full" person with a "sense of optimism". He told ITV 1's Trevor McDonald: "My father is a huge hero figure for me, because he's an amazingly brave man...."To have a disability in the 1930s and 1940s, a different age, was really tough, but  he never let it affect him in any way.

 Two groups have developed materials that can sense pressure as sensitively and quickly as human skin. The skins are arrays of small pressure sensors that convert tiny changes in pressure into electrical signals. The materials could be used to sheath artificial limbs or to create robots that can pick up and hold fragile objects.

1. The TUC's annual gathering backed a motion which included calls to build "a broad solidarity alliance of unions and communities under threat". 2. TUC chief Brendan Barber warned that big cuts would make Britain a "dark, brutish and more frightening place". 3. The PM's spokesman said they wanted "partnership" with the unions to tackle the deficit. 4. Most Whitehall departments have been ordered to plan for savings of between 25% and 40% ahead of the comprehensive spending review of 20 October. 5. Delegates debated a motion calling for the TUC's general council to "support and co-ordinate campaigning and joint union industrial action, nationally and locally, in opposition to attacks on jobs, pensions, pay or public services". 6. It could lead to different unions calling strikes on the same days if the cuts are not scaled back, although BBC Political Editor Nick Robinson said trade union laws and union leaders' desire to build a wide coalition against the cuts made a "winter of discontent" unlikely. 7. The motion rejected the idea that cuts were necessary to pay for the deficit and said they were a "savage and opportunistic attack on public services" which "goes far further than even the dark days of Thatcher". 8. TUC general secretary Mr Barber told delegates: "These are not temporary cuts, but a permanent rollback of public services and the welfare state. Not so much an economic necessity as a political project driven by an ideological clamour for a minimal state." 9. He said no-one took industrial action lightly, but added: "Where members, faced with attacks on jobs, pay or pensions take a democratic decision for industrial action, they will have the support of unions and the TUC stands ready to co-ordinate that." 10. Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude told the BBC: "We will listen very carefully to what they [the unions] say and the arguments that they make, there's no question about that. We are not going back to the days where there's a complete stand-off between the trade unions and the government. Those days are gone." 11. Downing Street also said the government wanted "a genuine partnership with the trade unions". 12. The PM's spokesman said. "We need to deal with the deficit, we want to work with everyone in tackling that." 13. Unite, the UK's biggest union, says it wants a "robust campaign" to protect public services, while the G

 The Natural History Museum in London has a forensic entomology unit which breeds different species of fly to help the police solve crimes. The unit is staffed by three forensic entomologists, one of whom is Amoret Whitaker. As soon as a person dies, their body starts to decompose and they give off specific odours which are very attractive to insects, particularly blowflies. When someone dies, blowflies are attracted to the body and they will start laying eggs immediately. These will hatch into larvae or maggots and the developmental cycle will continue. By understanding the "succession" rates or the speed of growth of flies, from an egg to the larval then adult stage, scientists can determine the likely time that person died. The accuracy of that timing depends partly on how long the body has been decomposing. If scientists can get to see a corpse within days of its death, when that person died can be worked out to an accuracy within hours. But, if the body has lain undiscovered for weeks, or even months, then the precision of timing can be narrowed to a matter of days. This timing can even be used to help determine whether a suspicious death should be treated as murder. The time of year can dramatically affect how a body decomposes. In one case Amoret and colleagues were involved in, a man disappeared in November but his body was not discovered until the following February. One pathologist report suggested the body had been dead for just a few weeks. In fact because he had died in winter his body had effectively been "mummified". The critical evidence came from Calliphora vicina, a bluebottle blowfly often found on dead bodies. C vicina grows all year round but in winter its development slows right down. While it remains alive, it becomes inactive at temperatures below 1C. This peculiarly slow rate of development meant Amoret and colleagues could prove the man had died months ago rather than weeks. The man had left a pub, taken a short-cut home then slipped and broken his neck. The police regularly use Amoret and her colleagues' expertise. Forensic entomology can even be used in cases of burnt bodies, as insects may still be found, feeding within the body cavities. Between working with police in the UK and research at the Natural History Museum, Amoret also works at the anthropology department at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. She compares the decomposition of dead pigs and human cadavers. Some people have nicknamed this place the "body farm". In the summers

Free TOEFL TPO Intermediate Reading Test 2 Passage 2  The following passage is adapted from a book about the history of the United States.  The American Revolution was a political upheaval that took place between 1765 and 1783 during which colonists in the Thirteen American Colonies rejected the British monarchy and aristocracy, overthrew the authority of Great Britain, and founded the United States of America. The revolution was the result of a combination of long-term social, political, and intellectual transformations in the colonies, in particular the emergence of republican values that emphasized civic duty and the rights of man, and the development of a sense of American political identity. The revolution also had short-term causes, including the British government's attempts to raise revenue through taxation and the colonists' resistance to new taxes, which they saw as a violation of their rights as British subjects.  The revolution began in 1765 with the passage of the Stamp Act, which required colonists to pay a tax on all printed materials, including newspapers, legal
4% of men with unexplained infertility carry mutations in the NR5A1 gene, according to research from the Pasteur Institute in France and University College London. The gene is already known to be involved in sexual development in both men and women, and defects in NR5A1 have been linked to physical defects in the development of the testicles or ovaries. The findings suggest that, even where there is no physical evidence of a problem, defects in the gene may be hampering the ability to make sperm. The research looked at the gene in 315 apparently healthy men who had an unexplained inability to produce sperm. From this group, they found mutations in the gene in just seven, and closer examination revealed the men had altered levels of sex hormones and, in one case, mild abnormalities in the cellular structure of the testicles. The research authors said: "We conclude that approximately 4% of men with otherwise unexplained failure to produce sperm carry mutations in the NR5A1 gene." Dr Allan Pacey, a senior lecturer in andrology at the University of Sheffield, said that there was still "embarrassingly little" known about the genetics behind male infertility. Reply to this comment  Leave a comment  You need to log in or register to comment.

27 local people who fought in the Spanish Civil War have been honoured with a plaque at the Unite building in Islington. The plaque was previously located at the unemployed and trade union centre in Hardman Street. The 27 names on the plaque are believed to be only a portion of the 30 people from Merseyside who died fighting in the war. The UK government declared it illegal to fight in Spain as it tried to appease Hitler's fascist force in the lead up to the Second World War. The civil war ended after WWII had started. More than 300,000 people died and the Republicans were persecuted by the victorious nationalist parties. Franco's uprising was supported by the Hitler and Mussolini regimes. The Republic was short of weapons and medical supplies and it was basically strangled by the might of Franco. 500 of the 2,500 British people who fought in the Spanish Civil War did not survive. Jack Jones, the ardent trade unionist from Garston who was badly injured in the conflict, survived the war and became the leader of the Transport and General Workers' Union. He was heavily involved with the unions until he died aged 96 in April last year. Unite's regional secretary Paul Finegan said: "We feel very privileged."

1,600 Dolomedes plantarius spiderlings were released into suitable dykes at Castle Marshes between Lowestoft and Beccles on Wednesday. The spiderlings were hand-reared in the kitchen of project leader Dr Helen Smith, with the surplus reared at the John Innes Centre in Norwich. The hybrids bring the advantage of increased genetic variability to the new population, which should give the new population at Castle Marshes the best potential to adapt to its surroundings and to cope with the impacts of climate change. The project was organised by Natural England and Suffolk Wildlife Trust and was aided by a grant from the BBC Wildlife Fund. 0 0 0  Summarize the given document.

20 million people in Bangladesh have turned to microcredit to lift themselves out of poverty. Microfinance offers small loans to people who do not normally qualify for traditional banking credit, to encourage entrepreneurship. However, after the total destruction of their crops, villagers are not in a position to repay their loans. Yet the microfinance organisations continue to collect the instalments. Microfinance is not without its critics. Some argue that people can quickly sink into a cycle of debt, with many lenders charging exorbitant rates of interest. Dr Qazi Kholikuzzaman Ahmad, chairman of PKSF, a body that monitors microfinance, describes microcredit as a "death trap" for the poor. Women are the main borrowers in the village and they were attracted to microcredit because they could get the loans easily and quickly. When they are still unable to pay enough, the debt collectors insist that they sell their cattle, chickens and other household items. Many villagers finally turn to local usurers. Professor Yunus and his Grameen Bank were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering work in microfinance and he refers to many of the institutions which have followed his example as "the new loan sharks." His organisation has a policy whereby loans are rescheduled in times of natural disaster. After the floods in Bangladesh, the district administrations requested microfinance organisations to stop collecting instalments for the time being. But that call has gone unheeded. Dr Ahmad is dismayed. "There are some agencies which even take their payments from relief material," he says. 1. What is microfinance? 2. What is the main criticism of microfinance? 3.

1. Researchers have found that targeting a part of the brain called the parietal lobe improved the ability of volunteers to solve numerical problems. 2. The discovery could help people with dyscalculia, who may struggle with numbers. 3. Some studies have suggested that up to one in five people have trouble with maths, affecting not just their ability to complete problems but also to manage everyday activities such as telling the time and managing money. 4. Neuroscientists believe that activity within the parietal lobe plays a crucial role in this ability, or the lack of it. 5. When magnetic fields were used in earlier research to disrupt electrical activity in this part of the brain, previously numerate volunteers temporarily developed discalculia, finding it much harder to solve maths problems. 6. The latest research goes a step further, using a one milliamp current to stimulate the parietal lobe of a small number of students. 7. Those given the current from right to left across the parietal lobe did significantly better when given, compared to those who were given no electrical stimulation. 8. The direction of the current was important - those given stimulation running in the opposite direction, left to right, did markedly worse at these puzzles than those given no current, with their ability matching that of an average six-year-old. 9. The effects were not short-lived, either. When the volunteers whose performance improved was re-tested six months later, the benefits appear to have persisted. 10. There was no wider effect on general maths ability in either group, just on the ability to complete the puzzles learned as the current was applied. 11. Dr Cohen Kadosh, who led the study, said: "We are not advising people to go around giving themselves electric shocks, but we are extremely excited by the potential of our findings and are now looking into the underlying brain changes." 12. Dr Christopher Chambers, from the School of Psychology at Cardiff University, said that the results were "intriguing", and offered the prospect not just of improving numerical skills, but having an impact on a wider range of conditions. 13. Sue Flohr, from the British Dyslexia Association, which also provides support for people with dyscalculia, said the research was welcome. 14. It makes it very hard to do everyday things like shopping or budgeting - you can go into a shop and find you've spent your month's money without realising it." Correct Incorrect  
59 people have died and 617 others have been infected with cholera in Haiti, according to the country's health ministry. The outbreak began in the north of the country three weeks ago and has since spread to other areas. The hurricane that hit the country last week has exacerbated the situation, with the flooding increasing the risk of the disease spreading.

The Ministry of Health has confirmed 20 cases of cholera in Abidjan, with one death. The cases were reported in the districts of Abobo, Adjamé, Cocody, Koumassi, Marcory, Port-Bouët and Treichville.  The ministry has launched a campaign to raise awareness of the disease and to encourage people to take preventive measures.  "We are worried that the disease could spread to other parts of the country, especially as we are in the rainy season," said a health worker in the northern town of Korhogo.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the rainy season could increase the risk of cholera outbreaks in West Africa.  Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It is transmitted through contaminated water and food, and can cause severe dehydration and death if left untreated.  The disease is endemic in Côte d'Ivoire, with outbreaks occurring regularly. In 2009, there were 1,200 cases of cholera and 50 deaths.  Copyright © 2010 IRIN. All rights reserved.

37 year old Haile Gebrselassie, Olympic gold medallist and winner of more than 20 sporting records, has announced his retirement from competitive sports due to a knee injury. Gebrselassie has made a name for himself outside the sporting world, as a businessman, educator, philanthropist and art collector. He and his wife, Alem, have three daughters and one son. He is one of the Elders, a group of Ethiopians who have mediated in political crises in the country since 2005. Gebrselassie is involved in international campaigns against climate change and malaria. He founded the Great Ethiopian Run, which has since become known as Africa's biggest road race. He is so beloved in Ethiopia that in 2001, the country's best known musician Tedi Afro composed a song in his honour and with his name. Some believe that Gebrselassie may not have finished running - but that his next race may well be a political one. 1.

1. The National Alliance is a Shia parliamentary bloc formed after the March 2010 elections as a result of a merger of Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's State of Law coalition and the Iraqi National Alliance (INA). 2. The State of Law Coalition is led by outgoing Prime Minister Maliki, who has been seeking a second term in power. 3. The Iraqi National Alliance (INA) is a mainly Shia alliance which includes followers of the powerful cleric and one-time militia leader Moqtada al-Sadr. 4. The Kurdish coalition is dominated by the two parties administering Iraq's northern, semi-autonomous Kurdish region. 5. The Iraqiya alliance won the election by a slim two-seat margin over outgoing Prime Minister Maliki's State of Law, but neither came anywhere near the majority needed to govern. 6. Unity of Iraq has adopted a similar rhetoric to Mr Maliki's State of Law list. 7. The Iraqi Accord Front, an alliance of parties led by Sunni politicians, participated in the December 2005 elections but has since been weakened by splits and defections. 8. Smaller minorities, including Turkmen, Christians, Yazidis, Sabean Mandaeans, Shabak and others, were thought likely to ally with bigger electoral lists in areas where they were not dominant. 9. Tribal leaders were courted by major parties as it was thought they would play an important role in the election. Some of Iraq's Sunni tribal leaders sprang to prominence when US forces began backing local sheikhs against al-Qaeda in 2006. 10. While the tribal figures are looking to branch out into mainstream politics, they have not formed a united front and have mainly joined forces with existing blocs. 11. The contenders have had to forge new partnerships and deals in their efforts to share out the positions of power. 12. Many of the minority Sunnis apparently aren't confident that Maliki truly believes they should be given a large share of power. 13. The Kurds have played king-maker in Iraq since the 2003 invasion and will likely retain enough clout to be part of a ruling alliance with another faction. 14. Al-Iraqiyya, and Saleh al-Mutlaq in particular, have a more consistent anti-sectarian perspective than most of their rivals. 15. The Unity of Iraq list was seriously affected by the ban on candidates with alleged Baathist links. 16. The National Alliance decided in October to support Mr
 A conference is being held in Wales to establish a national place-name society.  Welsh place names are particularly important as they tend to be descriptive of the conditions at the time of naming, whereas English place-names are subject to obscure influences from Latin, German, French and Scandinavian languages.  Despite the rich source of information which they could hold, Wales does not have a national place-name body monitoring trends and derivations, as does Scotland, England and Northern Ireland.  The conference is being opened with an address by Culture Minister Alun Ffred Jones.  Mr Brown is hoping this will prove indicative of more concrete support for the project.  Some within the group would like to see legislation brought before the assembly to prevent historic Welsh place names becoming anglicised or changed altogether to ones with no local significance.  Even if the resources weren't available to police it rigorously, the simple presence of legislation would send out a message of the importance that Welsh place names continue to have to this day.
