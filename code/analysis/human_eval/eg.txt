Many other comments have been posted on the appeal page. Steph Harris said: “Thinking of you all at this devastating time, fly high beautiful princess. Love Steph and family xxx” Lesley Andrews added: “No amount of money will take away the pain, but so much love comes with every penny. Take care. xx” Aster Group, the housing association responsible for managing the home, is assisting with the police investigation. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is also investigating.
